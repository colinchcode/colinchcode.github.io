Mixed frequency data refers to a situation where we have observations at different time intervals. For example, we might have daily data for one variable and monthly data for another variable. In such cases, forecasting becomes challenging as traditional time series models assume a fixed time interval.

One way to handle mixed frequency data is by using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. ARIMA models have been widely used for time series forecasting and can be adapted to handle mixed frequency data.

Here is an example of how to forecast mixed frequency data using ARIMA in Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm

# Read the data
daily_data = pd.read_csv('daily_data.csv')
monthly_data = pd.read_csv('monthly_data.csv')

# Set the index to datetime
daily_data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(daily_data['date'])
daily_data.set_index('date', inplace=True)
monthly_data['date'] = pd.to_datetime(monthly_data['date'])
monthly_data.set_index('date', inplace=True)

# Fit ARIMA model on the daily data
model = sm.tsa.ARIMA(daily_data['value'], order=(1, 1, 1))
model_fit = model.fit()

# Forecast the monthly data using the fitted ARIMA model
forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=len(monthly_data))

# Create a new DataFrame to store the forecasted values
forecasted_values = pd.DataFrame(index=monthly_data.index)
forecasted_values['forecast'] = forecast[0]

# Print the forecasted values
print(forecasted_values)
```

In this example, we first read the daily and monthly data from separate CSV files using the `pd.read_csv` function. We then set the index of both DataFrames to datetime using `pd.to_datetime` and `set_index`.

Next, we fit an ARIMA model on the daily data using the `sm.tsa.ARIMA` function from the `statsmodels` library. In this case, we use an order of (1, 1, 1) for the ARIMA model, but you can adjust this order based on your data and requirements.

After fitting the model, we use the `forecast` method to forecast the values for the monthly data. The `steps` parameter specifies the number of steps to forecast.

Finally, we create a new DataFrame to store the forecasted values and print the result.

Note that this is a simple example to demonstrate the concept of forecasting with mixed frequency data using ARIMA. There are more advanced techniques and models available for dealing with such data, especially when dealing with large-scale and complex datasets.

For more information on ARIMA models and time series forecasting in Python, refer to the following resources:

- [Statsmodels documentation](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
- [Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

Remember, it is always important to preprocess and analyze your data before applying any forecasting models to ensure accurate and meaningful results.
