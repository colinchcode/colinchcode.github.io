## Introduction

Prefect provides a powerful monitoring system that allows you to visualize the status and progress of your workflows. While Prefect offers its own built-in dashboard, in some cases, you may need to create a custom dashboard tailored to your specific requirements.

In this tutorial, we will use Python to build a simple dashboard that displays the information from your Prefect workflows in a format that suits your needs.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your machine
- Prefect installed (`pip install prefect`)

## Installation

Before we proceed, let's install the necessary libraries:

```python
pip install dash dash-bootstrap-components prefect
```

## Creating the Dashboard

To get started, we need to import the necessary libraries and initialize the Prefect client:

```python
import dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import prefect

app = dash.Dash(external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
client = prefect.Client()
```

Next, we can fetch the list of all active flows from Prefect:

```python
flows = client.graphql({
    'query': {
        'query': 'query { flows(state: ACTIVE) { name id }}'
    }
})

flow_list = flows.data.flows
```

Once we have the list of flows, we can create a basic layout for our dashboard:

```python
app.layout = dbc.Container(
    [
        dbc.Row(
            dbc.Col(
                html.H1("Prefect Dashboard", className="text-center my-4")
            )
        ),
        dbc.Row(
            dbc.Col(
                children=[
                    dbc.Card(
                        [
                            dbc.CardHeader("Active Flows"),
                            dbc.CardBody(
                                html.Table(
                                    # Display the list of flows
                                    children=[
                                        html.Tr(html.Td(flow['name'])) for flow in flow_list
                                    ]
                                )
                            ),
                        ],
                        className="mb-4",
                    ),
                ]
            )
        ),
    ],
    fluid=True,
)
```

Finally, we can run the application:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

## Customizing the Dashboard

This is a very basic example to get you started. You can customize the dashboard by adding more components or enhancing the existing ones. For example, you can display additional information about each flow, such as the last run time or the current status.

Additionally, you can use the `dcc.Interval` component to update the dashboard automatically at a specific interval. This can be useful for real-time monitoring.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to create a simple dashboard for monitoring Prefect workflows using Python and the Dash library. With this foundation, you can customize the dashboard to suit your specific requirements and build a comprehensive monitoring system for your workflows.
