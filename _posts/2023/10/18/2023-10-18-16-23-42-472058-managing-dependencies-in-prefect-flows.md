When working with complex data workflows, managing dependencies between tasks becomes crucial. Prefect, a modern workflow orchestration framework, provides a convenient way to define and manage these dependencies.

## Defining Dependencies

In Prefect, dependencies between tasks are defined using the `@task` decorator. This decorator signifies that a function represents a task in the workflow. When one task depends on the output of another task, the `@task` decorator can be used to express this dependency.

```python
from prefect import task

@task
def fetch_data():
    # Code to fetch data from a source
    return data

@task
def transform_data(raw_data):
    # Code to transform raw data
    return transformed_data
```

In the example above, the `transform_data` task depends on the `fetch_data` task. Prefect will automatically figure out the dependency between these tasks based on the function arguments and construct the appropriate workflow.

## Controlling Execution Order

Prefect provides additional tools to control the execution order of tasks. Dependencies between tasks can be explicitly defined using the `Dependency` class. This allows for more fine-grained control over the workflow execution.

```python
from prefect import Task, Flow, Dependency

class FetchDataTask(Task):
    def run(self):
        # Code to fetch data from a source
        return data

class TransformDataTask(Task):
    def run(self, raw_data):
        # Code to transform raw data
        return transformed_data

fetch_task = FetchDataTask()
transform_task = TransformDataTask()

transform_task.depends_on(Dependency(fetch_task, key='output'))

with Flow('data-flow') as flow:
    data = fetch_task()
    transformed_data = transform_task(data)
```

In this example, the `depends_on` method is used to define the dependency between the `fetch_task` and `transform_task`. The `key` argument is optional and can be used to specify a specific output from the `fetch_task`. This provides more flexibility when dealing with multiple outputs from a task.

## Parallel Execution

Prefect also supports parallel execution of tasks. By default, tasks run sequentially, but if there are no dependencies between tasks, they can be executed in parallel. This can lead to improved performance for workflows with independent tasks.

```python
from prefect import task, Flow

@task
def task1():
    # Code for task 1

@task
def task2():
    # Code for task 2

@task
def task3():
    # Code for task 3

with Flow('parallel-flow') as flow:
    t1 = task1()
    t2 = task2()
    t3 = task3()

t1.set_upstream(t2)
t2.set_upstream(t3)
```

In this example, `task1`, `task2`, and `task3` can run in parallel since there are no dependencies between them. The `set_upstream` method is used to specify the dependency between tasks.

## Conclusion

Managing dependencies in data workflows is made easy with Prefect. By defining dependencies between tasks and controlling the execution order, you can build complex workflows and ensure their smooth execution. Additionally, Prefect provides features for parallel execution, further enhancing the efficiency of your workflows.
