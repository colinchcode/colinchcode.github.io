When working with data pipelines, it's often useful to cache the results of computationally expensive tasks to improve performance and reduce unnecessary computation. In Prefect, you can easily implement result caching using the built-in caching functionality.

To enable result caching in Prefect, you need to configure a cache backend. Let's take a look at an example of caching results using Redis as the cache backend.

```python
import prefect
from prefect import task, Flow
from prefect.engine.results import LocalResult, PrefectResult
from prefect.engine.caches import RedisCache

@task(cache_key="add_numbers", result=PrefectResult())
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Configure the Redis cache backend
cache = RedisCache(
    host="localhost",
    port=6379,
    db=0,
)

# Create a Prefect flow
with Flow("Add Numbers Flow") as flow:
    result = add_numbers(5, 10)

# Set the cache backend for the flow
flow.set_task_cache(cache)

# Run the flow
flow.run()
```

In this example, we define a task called `add_numbers` that adds two numbers together. We set the `cache_key` option to "add_numbers" which will be used to identify this task's cached result. We also configure the `result` to use the `PrefectResult` which is a default result handler that can store and retrieve results using the cache.

To enable caching, we need to create a cache instance. In this case, we create a `RedisCache` instance with the Redis server details. You can replace these details with your own Redis server information.

Finally, we set the created cache instance as the task cache for the flow using the `set_task_cache` method. This will enable result caching for all tasks in the flow.

When you run the flow, Prefect will check the cache backend to see if the task has already been executed with the given inputs. If the result is found in the cache, Prefect will use the cached result instead of re-computing the task.

Caching results can significantly speed up the execution of Prefect flows, especially when dealing with large datasets or computationally intensive tasks. It allows you to avoid unnecessary computation and increases the efficiency of your data pipelines.

You can find more information about caching in Prefect in the [official documentation](https://docs.prefect.io/api/latest/engine/caching.html).
