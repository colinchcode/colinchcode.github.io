Webhooks are a popular way to receive real-time notifications from various services. However, managing multiple webhooks efficiently can be a complex task. In this article, we will explore how to handle multiple webhooks in Python.

## Introduction

To manage multiple webhooks effectively, we need a structured approach. We will create a webhook manager class that will handle the management and processing of webhooks. This class will allow us to register, update, and delete webhooks, as well as handle incoming webhook events.

## Creating a Webhook Manager

Let's begin by creating a `WebhookManager` class. This class will keep track of all the registered webhooks and provide methods to manage them.

```python
class WebhookManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.webhooks = []

    def register_webhook(self, url):
        self.webhooks.append(url)

    def update_webhook(self, old_url, new_url):
        if old_url in self.webhooks:
            index = self.webhooks.index(old_url)
            self.webhooks[index] = new_url

    def delete_webhook(self, url):
        if url in self.webhooks:
            self.webhooks.remove(url)
```

In the `__init__` method, we initialize an empty list to store the registered webhooks. The `register_webhook` method adds a new webhook URL to the list. The `update_webhook` method updates an existing webhook URL with a new URL. Finally, the `delete_webhook` method removes a webhook URL from the list.

## Registering Webhooks

To register webhooks, we can create an instance of the `WebhookManager` class and use its `register_webhook` method.

```python
webhook_manager = WebhookManager()
webhook_manager.register_webhook("https://example.com/webhook1")
webhook_manager.register_webhook("https://example.com/webhook2")
```

Here, we have registered two example webhooks.

## Handling Webhook Events

To handle incoming webhook events, we can create a separate function. Let's create a `handle_webhook_event` function that will iterate over all registered webhooks and perform some action (e.g., send a notification) for each event.

```python
def handle_webhook_event(event_data):
    for url in webhook_manager.webhooks:
        # Perform an action for each webhook event
        send_notification(url, event_data)
```

In this function, we iterate over the `webhooks` list and call a `send_notification` function with the webhook URL and the event data.

With these basic components, you can manage and handle multiple webhooks efficiently in your Python applications.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to manage multiple webhooks in Python. We created a `WebhookManager` class to handle registering, updating, and deleting webhooks. We also implemented a function to handle webhook events by iterating over the registered webhooks and performing some action for each event.

By having a structured approach like this, you can easily manage and process multiple webhooks in your Python applications.
