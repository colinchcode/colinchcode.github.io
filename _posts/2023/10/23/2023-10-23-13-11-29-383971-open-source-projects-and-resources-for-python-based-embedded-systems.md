Python is a versatile and popular programming language that can be used for a wide range of applications, including embedded systems. If you are interested in developing embedded solutions using Python, there are several open-source projects and resources available that can help you get started. In this article, we will explore some of these projects and resources.

## 1. CircuitPython

CircuitPython is a variant of Python specifically designed for microcontrollers and embedded systems. It provides a simplified and beginner-friendly API for interacting with hardware components such as sensors, actuators, and displays. CircuitPython has an active and supportive community, and there are plenty of example projects and libraries available to get you started.
