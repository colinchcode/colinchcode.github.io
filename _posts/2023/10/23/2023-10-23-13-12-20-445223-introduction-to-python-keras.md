Keras is a powerful and popular Python library used for developing and training deep learning models. It provides a user-friendly and intuitive API that makes it easy to build neural networks and experiment with different architectures.

In this tutorial, we will give you a brief introduction to Keras and demonstrate how to build a simple neural network for image classification.

## Installing Keras
To get started with Keras, you need to install it and its dependencies. You can use pip, the Python package manager, to install Keras:

```python
pip install keras
```
Keras uses a backend to perform the computations, such as TensorFlow or Theano. You need to install a backend as well. For example, to use TensorFlow as the backend, you can install it with:

```python
pip install tensorflow
```

## Building a Simple Neural Network
Once you have installed Keras, you can start building your neural network. In this example, we will build a simple network with three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with 64 neurons, and an output layer with 10 neurons representing the classes.

Start by importing the required modules:

```python
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
```

Next, create an instance of the Sequential class, which represents a linear stack of layers:

```python
model = Sequential()
```

Add the layers to the model one by one:

```python
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

In the code above, we define the dimensions of each layer and specify the activation function for the hidden layer (ReLU) and the output layer (Softmax).

## Training the Model
After building the network, you need to compile it and define the loss function and optimization algorithm:

```python
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

Next, you can train the model with your data:

```python
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

In the code above, `x_train` represents the input data and `y_train` represents the target labels. You can specify the number of epochs (iterations) and the batch size for training.

## Evaluating the Model
Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance on new data:

```python
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Loss: {loss}, Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```

The `evaluate` method returns the loss and accuracy of the model on the given test data.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we covered the basics of using Keras to build and train a simple neural network for image classification. Keras provides an easy-to-use interface for deep learning and can be a great choice for beginners and researchers. Experiment with different architectures and datasets to further explore the capabilities of Keras and deep learning.
