Webhooks are a way for applications to communicate with each other in real-time. They are widely used for event-driven architectures, integration with third-party services, and real-time notifications.

In this blog post, we will explore how to handle different types of webhook events in Python. We will use Flask, a Python web framework, to create a webhook endpoint and receive incoming events. Let's get started!

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of Python and Flask.

## Setting Up the Flask Application

First, let's set up a basic Flask application to receive webhook events. Open your favorite text editor and create a new Python file named `app.py`. Here's some sample code to get you started:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    event_data = request.get_json()
    # Process the event data here
    return jsonify(success=True)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this code, we define a route `/webhook` that listens for a `POST` request. When a request is received, we extract the JSON payload using `request.get_json()`. You can then process the event data as per your requirements. For now, we simply return a JSON response with `{"success": true}`.

To run the Flask application, open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing `app.py`, and run the following command:

```
python app.py
```

Your Flask application is now set up and ready to receive webhook events.

## Handling Different Types of Events

Now that we have set up the Flask application, let's dive into handling different types of webhook events. The exact process will depend on the service or platform that sends the webhooks. Here, we'll provide a generic approach.

When receiving a webhook event, you typically extract the event type from the event payload. Based on the event type, you can then perform specific actions or trigger relevant functions.

```python
@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def handle_webhook():
    event_data = request.get_json()
    event_type = event_data.get('type')

    if event_type == 'order_created':
        handle_order_created(event_data)
    elif event_type == 'order_updated':
        handle_order_updated(event_data)
    else:
        return jsonify(success=False, error='Unknown event type')

    return jsonify(success=True)
```

In this code, we extract the `type` field from the event payload and use it to determine the event type. You can define separate functions like `handle_order_created` and `handle_order_updated` to process each event type.

Within the event handlers, you can access specific data from the event payload and perform the necessary actions. For example, you might save the order details to a database, send a notification to the user, or trigger another API call.

## Conclusion

Handling different types of webhook events in Python is a common task when integrating with various services and platforms. By using Flask and extracting the event type from the webhook payload, you can easily trigger specific actions based on the type of event received.

Remember to properly handle error cases and unknown event types to provide a robust and reliable webhook integration.

I hope this blog post has helped you understand how to handle different types of webhook events in Python. Happy coding!
