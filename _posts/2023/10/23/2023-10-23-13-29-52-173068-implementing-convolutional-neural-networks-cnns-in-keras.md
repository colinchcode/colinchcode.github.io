## Introduction to CNNs
CNNs are a special type of neural network designed to process and analyze visual data. They are composed of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. CNNs are particularly effective in capturing spatial and hierarchical features from images, which makes them ideal for image classification tasks.

## Installing Keras
Before we start building our CNN, we need to install the Keras library. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install keras
```

This command will install the latest version of Keras along with its dependencies.

## Building a CNN in Keras
In this example, we will build a simple CNN architecture for MNIST digit classification. Let's go through the steps involved in creating the network.

### Importing Libraries and Loading the Data
First, we need to import the necessary libraries and load the MNIST dataset:

```python
import keras
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Load and split the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Reshape the input images
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)

# Normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1]
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255

# Convert the class labels to one-hot encoded vectors
y_train = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=10)
y_test = keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=10)
```

### Creating the CNN Architecture
Next, we define the CNN architecture using Keras' Sequential model:

```python
# Initialize the model
model = Sequential()

# Add a convolutional layer with 32 filters and a 3x3 kernel
model.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)))

# Add a max pooling layer with a 2x2 pool size
model.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

# Flatten the feature maps to a 1D vector
model.add(Flatten())

# Add a fully connected layer with 128 neurons
model.add(Dense(128, activation='relu'))

# Add the output layer with 10 neurons for 10 classes
model.add(Dense(10, activation='softmax'))
```

### Compiling the Model
After defining the network architecture, we need to compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric:

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Training and Evaluating the CNN
With the model architecture and compilation set up, we can now train and evaluate the CNN on the MNIST dataset:

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, batch_size=128, epochs=10, validation_split=0.2)

# Evaluate the model on the test set
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print('Test accuracy:', accuracy)
```

## Conclusion
In this article, we learned how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras for image classification tasks. We covered the key steps involved in building and training the CNN. Keras provides a high-level interface for building deep learning models, making it easier to experiment with different architectures and datasets.
