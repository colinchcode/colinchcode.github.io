Logstash is a widely used open source tool for collecting, parsing, and forwarding logs, and it supports various log formats. In this article, we will explore some of the different log formats that Logstash can handle in Python.

## 1. Common Log Format (CLF)
The Common Log Format is a widely used log format for web servers. It consists of the following fields:

```
{hostname} {remote_logname} {remote_user} [{timestamp}] "{method} {url} {protocol}" {status_code} {bytes_sent}
```

To parse CLF log entries in Logstash, you can use the following configuration:

```python
filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{IPORHOST:clientip} %{HTTPDUSER:ident} %{USERNAME:auth} \[%{HTTPDATE:timestamp}\] \"%{WORD:method} %{NOTSPACE:request} HTTP/%{NUMBER:httpversion}\" %{NUMBER:response:int} (?:%{NUMBER:bytes:int}|-)" }
  }
}
```

## 2. JSON Log Format
JSON log format is commonly used to store structured log data. Each log entry is in JSON format and contains various key-value pairs. To parse JSON logs in Logstash, you can use the following configuration:

```python
filter {
  json {
    source => "message"
  }
}
```

## 3. Apache Combined Log Format
The Apache Combined Log Format is an extension of the Common Log Format and includes additional fields, such as the referrer and user agent. To parse Apache Combined Log Format entries in Logstash, you can use the following configuration:

```python
filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{COMBINEDAPACHELOG}" }
  }
}
```

## 4. Syslog
Syslog is a standard logging protocol used by network devices and Unix-like operating systems. To parse syslog messages in Logstash, you can use the following configuration:

```python
filter {
  grok {
    match => { "message" => "%{SYSLOGTIMESTAMP:timestamp} %{SYSLOGHOST:host} %{DATA:program}(?:\[%{POSINT:pid}\])?: %{GREEDYDATA:message}" }
  }
}
```

These are just a few examples of the log formats that Logstash supports in Python. Logstash provides a wide range of plugins and filters to handle different log formats. You can refer to the Logstash documentation for more details on configuring Logstash to handle specific log formats.
