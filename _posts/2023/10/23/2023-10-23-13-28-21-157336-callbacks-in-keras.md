In Keras, callbacks are a powerful tool for monitoring and controlling the training of your deep learning models. Callbacks are functions that are executed at specific points during the training process, such as at the end of each epoch or after a certain number of steps. They provide a way to customize and add additional functionality to your training loop.

Keras provides a set of built-in callback functions that you can easily use, or you can create your own custom callbacks. Let's take a look at some of the commonly used built-in callbacks in Keras.

### 1. ModelCheckpoint

The `ModelCheckpoint` callback allows you to save the best model during training. You can specify various criteria for determining the best model, such as the highest validation accuracy or the lowest validation loss. This is useful when you want to save the model weights at the point where it performs the best.

```python
from keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint

checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(filepath, monitor='val_loss', save_best_only=True)
```

### 2. EarlyStopping

The `EarlyStopping` callback stops the training early if a specified metric has stopped improving. This can prevent overfitting and save training time by stopping the training process when there is no significant improvement in performance.

```python
from keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping

early_stopping = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', patience=3)
```

### 3. ReduceLROnPlateau

The `ReduceLROnPlateau` callback dynamically adjusts the learning rate during training. It reduces the learning rate when a specified metric has stopped improving, which can help the model converge faster.

```python
from keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau

reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_loss', patience=2)
```

### 4. TensorBoard

The `TensorBoard` callback allows you to visualize metrics and monitor the training process using TensorBoard. TensorBoard is a useful tool for visualizing your model's metrics, including loss, accuracy, and network graph.

```python
from keras.callbacks import TensorBoard

tensorboard = TensorBoard(log_dir='logs', histogram_freq=1)
```

These are just a few examples of the built-in callbacks available in Keras. You can also create your custom callbacks by subclassing the `keras.callbacks.Callback` class and implementing the required methods.

By using callbacks in Keras, you can enhance your training workflow and have more control over your deep learning models. To learn more about the available callbacks and their usage, refer to the [Keras documentation](https://keras.io/api/callbacks/).
