In Python Logstash, log rotation is an essential feature that helps manage log files efficiently. Log rotation ensures that log files don't grow infinitely, taking up excessive disk space. Moreover, it allows for easier log file management and prevents potential issues arising from large log files.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to configure log rotation in Python Logstash, using the `logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler` module.

## Introduction to log rotation

Log rotation is the process of managing log files by periodically switching to a new file once the existing file reaches a certain size or time limit. This ensures that log files remain manageable and that the system does not run out of disk space.

Python's `logging` module provides the `RotatingFileHandler` class, which allows us to rotate log files based on specified criteria.

## Using `RotatingFileHandler`

To configure log rotation in Python Logstash, we need to import the `RotatingFileHandler` class from the `logging.handlers` module. This class takes several parameters to define the rotation behavior.

## Configuration options

The `RotatingFileHandler` class accepts the following parameters:

- `filename`: Path to the log file.
- `mode`: File mode (default: `'a'` for appending).
- `maxBytes`: Maximum file size (in bytes) before rotation occurs (default: 0 which disables rotation based on file size).
- `backupCount`: Number of backup log files to keep (default: 0 which disables rotation based on number of files).
- `encoding`: File encoding (default: None).
- `delay`: Whether to delay file opening until the first log record is emitted (default: False).

## Example usage

Let's consider an example where we want to configure log rotation with a maximum file size of 1 MB and keep a maximum of 5 backup log files.

```python
import logging
from logging.handlers import RotatingFileHandler

# Create logger
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Create rotating file handler
rotate_handler = RotatingFileHandler(filename='app.log', maxBytes=1000000, backupCount=5)
rotate_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Set log format
formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
rotate_handler.setFormatter(formatter)

# Add the rotating file handler to logger
logger.addHandler(rotate_handler)

# Log some messages
logger.info("This is an info message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
```

In this example, we import the necessary modules and create a logger object with the desired log level. We then create an instance of the `RotatingFileHandler` class, specifying the log file name, maximum file size, and the number of backup log files to keep. Finally, we set the log format and add the rotating file handler to the logger.

## Further customization

The `RotatingFileHandler` class provides additional customization options such as changing the log filename pattern based on time, compressing backup log files, and more. You can refer to the official Python documentation for detailed information on these options.

## Conclusion

Configuring log rotation in Python Logstash is crucial for managing log files effectively. By using the `RotatingFileHandler` class from the `logging.handlers` module, you can easily set up log rotation based on file size, number of files, and other criteria. This ensures that your log files stay manageable, preventing excessive disk usage and potential issues.
