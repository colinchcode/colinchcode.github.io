In Logstash, there are various input plugins available to fetch data from different sources. If you prefer using Python to fetch data for Logstash, there are some input plugins specifically designed for Python developers. In this article, we will explore a few popular Logstash input plugins for Python.

### 1. Logstash input exec plugin

The **exec plugin** allows you to execute shell commands or scripts and fetch the output as input data for Logstash. This plugin supports Python scripts as well.

Example configuration:
```ruby
input {
  exec {
    command => "python path/to/script.py"
    interval => 60
    codec => "json"
  }
}
```

### 2. Logstash input syslog plugin with UDP

The **syslog plugin** allows you to fetch data via the syslog protocol. By using the UDP variant of this plugin, you can receive syslog messages from remote servers in a Python-friendly way.

Example configuration:
```ruby
input {
  syslog {
    port => 514
    codec => "json"
    type => "syslog_sample"
    udp => true
  }
}
```

### 3. Logstash input jdbc plugin with Python driver

The **jdbc plugin** enables fetching data from relational databases using JDBC drivers. If you are using a database with a Python-specific JDBC driver, you can utilize this plugin to import data into Logstash from Python.

Example configuration:
```ruby
input {
  jdbc {
    jdbc_driver_library => "/path/to/python/jdbc/driver.jar"
    jdbc_driver_class => "com.example.Driver"
    jdbc_connection_string => "jdbc:example://localhost:5432/mydb"
    jdbc_user => "username"
    jdbc_password => "password"
    statement => "SELECT * FROM my_table"
    codec => "json"
  }
}
```

These are just a few examples of Logstash input plugins that can be used with Python. Depending on your specific use case, you can explore other available plugins and choose the one that best fits your requirements.
