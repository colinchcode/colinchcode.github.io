In this tutorial, we will learn how to send a GET request using the Python `requests` library. The `requests` library is a popular and easy-to-use HTTP library for Python, which allows you to send HTTP requests and perform various operations such as sending data, handling cookies, and much more.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the `requests` library installed on your machine. You can install it using `pip` by running the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install requests
```

## Sending a GET request

To send a GET request using `requests`, you can make use of the `get()` method provided by the library. Here's a simple example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')

if response.status_code == 200:
    print('GET request successful!')
    print(response.json())
else:
    print('Error:', response.status_code)
```

In the code above, we import the `requests` module and use the `get()` method to send a GET request to the specified URL. We store the response in the `response` variable.

We then check the status code of the response using the `status_code` attribute. If the status code is `200` (indicating a successful request), we print a success message and display the response data using the `json()` method. Otherwise, we print an error message along with the status code.

You can replace `'https://api.example.com/users'` with the URL of your choice. Make sure the URL is accessible and returns a valid response.

That's it! You have successfully sent a GET request using Python `requests`.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to send a GET request using the Python `requests` library. We explored the basic syntax and used the `get()` method to make the request. You can further explore the `requests` library to perform advanced operations like handling authentication, headers, and query parameters. Happy coding!
