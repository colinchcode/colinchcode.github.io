Bluetooth technology has become ubiquitous in our daily lives, being used in various applications ranging from wireless headphones to IoT devices. However, with the increasing popularity of Bluetooth, the vulnerability of these devices to security threats has also increased. One such threat is the presence of anomalous Bluetooth devices that may potentially compromise user privacy and security.

In this blog post, we will explore how to perform anomaly detection on Bluetooth devices using Python. We will leverage the `pybluez` library, which provides Python wrappers for system Bluetooth resources, allowing us to interact with Bluetooth devices and gather relevant information for anomaly detection.

## Introduction

Anomaly detection is the process of identifying patterns or behaviors that deviate significantly from the expected norm. In the context of Bluetooth devices, we can consider devices that exhibit unusual characteristics or behavior as potential anomalies.

To perform anomaly detection, we need to first gather information about the Bluetooth devices available in the vicinity. This information can include the device name, address, signal strength, service classes, etc. By analyzing this information, we can detect devices that may be trying to impersonate legitimate devices or exhibit suspicious behavior.

## Setting Up the Environment

Before we start exploring Bluetooth device anomaly detection, we need to set up our environment. We will be using the `pybluez` library, which can be installed using the following command:

```shell
pip install pybluez
```

Make sure you have a compatible Bluetooth adapter connected to your system before proceeding.

## Detecting Bluetooth Devices

Let's start by writing a Python script to detect Bluetooth devices available in the vicinity. Create a new Python file `bluetooth_detection.py` and add the following code:

```python
import bluetooth

def detect_bluetooth_devices():
    nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices()
    for addr in nearby_devices:
        name = bluetooth.lookup_name(addr)
        print(f"Device Name: {name}, Device Address: {addr}")

detect_bluetooth_devices()
```

In the above code, we first import the `bluetooth` module and define a function `detect_bluetooth_devices()`. This function uses the `discover_devices()` method to detect nearby Bluetooth devices and retrieves their addresses. We then use the `lookup_name()` method to get the name of each device and print the device name and address.

Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python bluetooth_detection.py
```

You should see a list of Bluetooth devices along with their names and addresses printed on the console.

## Analyzing Bluetooth Device Information

Now that we can detect Bluetooth devices, let's dive deeper into their information. We can retrieve additional information about the devices such as the signal strength, service classes, supported profiles, etc. This information can be helpful in identifying anomalies.

Let's modify our previous script to display more detailed information about the devices:

```python
import bluetooth

def detect_bluetooth_devices():
    nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices(lookup_names=True, lookup_class=True, lookup_profiles=True)
    for addr, name, device_class, services in nearby_devices:
        print(f"Device Name: {name}")
        print(f"- Address: {addr}")
        print(f"- Class: {device_class}")
        print(f"- Services: {services}")
        print()

detect_bluetooth_devices()
```

In this updated code, we modify the `discover_devices()` method to include additional parameters for retrieving device names, classes, and service profiles. We loop through the devices and print their names, addresses, classes, and services.

Running the script will now display more detailed information about the Bluetooth devices.

## Implementing Anomaly Detection

Now that we have gathered information about Bluetooth devices, we can implement anomaly detection to identify potentially suspicious or anomalous devices. The exact criteria for detecting anomalies may vary based on the specific use case. In our case, we will consider devices with unknown or unusual device classes as potential anomalies.

```python
import bluetooth

def detect_bluetooth_devices():
    nearby_devices = bluetooth.discover_devices(lookup_names=True, lookup_class=True, lookup_profiles=True)
    for addr, name, device_class, services in nearby_devices:
        if device_class[0] == 0:
            print(f"Potential Anomaly Detected!")
            print(f"- Device Name: {name}")
            print(f"- Address: {addr}")
            print(f"- Class: {device_class}")
            print(f"- Services: {services}")
            print()

detect_bluetooth_devices()
```

In the above code, we add an if condition to check for the device class. If the device class is unknown (class code: 0), we consider it as a potential anomaly and print its details.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to perform Bluetooth device anomaly detection using Python. We used the `pybluez` library to detect nearby Bluetooth devices and gather information about them. We then analyzed the device information and implemented a simple anomaly detection algorithm based on device classes.

By performing anomaly detection on Bluetooth devices, we can enhance security and protect against potential threats. This can be particularly useful in environments where Bluetooth devices are used extensively, such as offices, public spaces, or IoT deployments.

Remember to stay updated with the latest security practices and recommendations to ensure the safety of your Bluetooth-enabled devices.
