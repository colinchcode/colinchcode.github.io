When working with HTTP requests in Python, the `requests` library is a popular choice due to its simplicity and ease of use. One powerful feature of the`requests` library is the ability to use request hooks, which allow you to modify the behavior of requests at various stages of their lifecycle.

Request hooks in `requests` are essentially callback functions that are executed at specific points during the request process. These hooks can be used to make modifications to the request headers, body, or even the response before it is returned.

## Available Request Hooks

Here are some of the available request hooks in `requests`:

- **pre_request**: This hook is called just before the request is sent. It can be used to modify the request headers or payload.

- **post_request**: This hook is called after the request has been sent and a response has been received. It can be used to modify the response or handle any post-processing.

- **response**: This hook is called after the response has been received. It can be used to handle common response processing tasks like checking for errors or parsing JSON.

- **retry**: This hook is called when a request needs to be retried. It can be used to implement custom retry logic or handle specific error conditions.

## Example: Adding Custom Headers to Requests

Let's say we want to add a custom header to every request made using `requests`. We can accomplish this by using the `pre_request` hook to modify the request headers.

```python
import requests

# Define the callback function to be used as a pre_request hook
def add_custom_header(request):
    request.headers['X-Custom-Header'] = 'Custom Value'

# Register the pre_request hook
requests.hooks['pre_request'] = add_custom_header

# Make a request
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com')

# Print the response headers
print(response.headers)
```

In the example above, we define the `add_custom_header` function which takes the `request` object as an argument. Inside this function, we add a custom header to the `request.headers` dictionary. Then, we assign this function as the callback for the `pre_request` hook using `requests.hooks['pre_request'] = add_custom_header`. Finally, we make a request to an API endpoint and print the response headers.

## Conclusion

Using request hooks in Python Requests allows you to modify the behavior of requests at various stages of their lifecycle. This can be useful for adding custom headers, performing post-processing, handling errors, or implementing custom retry logic. Understanding and effectively using request hooks can help you customize your HTTP requests to fit your specific needs.
