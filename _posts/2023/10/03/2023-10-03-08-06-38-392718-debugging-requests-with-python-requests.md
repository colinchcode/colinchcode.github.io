One of the most popular libraries for making HTTP requests in Python is the `requests` library. It provides a simple and intuitive way to send HTTP requests and handle responses. However, sometimes you may encounter issues or errors when making requests, and it can be challenging to figure out what exactly went wrong.

In this blog post, we'll explore some useful techniques for debugging requests made with Python `requests` library. These techniques can help you troubleshoot and identify the root cause of any issues you may encounter while making HTTP requests.

## 1. Enable request and response logging

By default, `requests` doesn't provide detailed information about the request and response. However, you can enable logging to get more insights into the underlying HTTP traffic. You can achieve this by configuring the `logging` module in Python.

```python
import logging
import requests

# Enable logging for the requests library
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Make a request
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com')

# Print the response
print(response.text)
```

By setting the logging level to `DEBUG`, you'll see detailed logs of the request and response, including HTTP headers, request URL, status code, and response body. This can be very helpful in understanding what's happening behind the scenes.

## 2. Inspect request headers and payload

In some cases, you may need to check the request headers and payload being sent to the server. `requests` library allows you to access this information easily.

```python
import requests

# Make a POST request with headers and payload
headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
payload = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com', headers=headers, json=payload)

# Print request headers and payload
print(response.request.headers)
print(response.request.body)
```

The `response.request.headers` attribute gives you access to the headers sent with the request, and `response.request.body` provides the payload sent, if applicable. This can be useful for troubleshooting issues related to incorrect or missing request headers.

## 3. Handle request exceptions

When making requests, it's important to handle exceptions gracefully. `requests` library provides various exception classes that you can catch to handle specific errors.

```python
import requests
from requests.exceptions import HTTPError, Timeout

try:
    # Make a request
    response = requests.get('https://api.example.com')

    # Raise an exception if the response status code is not successful
    response.raise_for_status()

    # Print the response
    print(response.text)

except HTTPError as err:
    # Handle HTTP errors
    print(f'HTTP error occurred: {err}')

except Timeout:
    # Handle timeouts
    print('Request timed out')

except Exception as err:
    # Handle other exceptions
    print(f'An error occurred: {err}')
```

By catching specific exceptions, you can handle different types of errors appropriately. This allows you to provide more meaningful error messages or take specific actions based on the error encountered.

## Conclusion

Debugging requests made with Python `requests` library can be made easier by using the techniques mentioned above. Enabling request and response logging, inspecting headers and payload, and handling exceptions can help you identify and resolve issues encountered while making HTTP requests.

By utilizing these debugging techniques, you can ensure that your application makes reliable and successful HTTP requests. Happy debugging!
