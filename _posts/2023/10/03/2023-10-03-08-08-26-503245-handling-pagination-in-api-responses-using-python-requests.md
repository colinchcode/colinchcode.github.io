When working with APIs, it's common to receive paginated responses. Pagination allows the server to return a limited number of results per page, making it easier to manage large datasets.

To handle pagination in API responses using Python and the Requests library, we can follow these steps:

## Table of Contents
- [Making the initial request](#making-the-initial-request)
- [Parsing the response](#parsing-the-response)
- [Iterating through pages](#iterating-through-pages)
- [Putting it all together](#putting-it-all-together)

## Making the initial request

To start, we need to make the initial request to the API endpoint. We can use the `requests.get()` method and pass any necessary parameters to specify the pagination details. For example, let's assume the API endpoint accepts the `page` parameter to indicate the page number and we want to fetch 10 results per page:

```python
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/endpoint"
params = {"page": 1, "limit": 10}  # Assuming the parameter names and values
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
```

## Parsing the response

Next, we need to extract the relevant information from the response. The response may contain the pagination metadata, such as the total number of records and the current page number. We can extract this information using the `json()` method provided by the `response` object:

```python
data = response.json()
total_records = data["metadata"]["total_records"]
current_page = data["metadata"]["current_page"]
results = data["results"]
```

## Iterating through pages

To fetch the remaining pages, we can use a loop. We'll continue making requests until we have retrieved all the desired records. Here's an example using a `while` loop:

```python
while current_page * params["limit"] < total_records:
    params["page"] += 1  # Increment page number
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    current_page = data["metadata"]["current_page"]
    results += data["results"]
```

## Putting it all together

To make pagination handling more reusable and cleaner, we can encapsulate the logic in a function. Here's an example of a function that retrieves all the paginated results:

```python
import requests

def fetch_all_results(url, params):
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = response.json()

    total_records = data["metadata"]["total_records"]
    current_page = data["metadata"]["current_page"]
    results = data["results"]

    while current_page * params["limit"] < total_records:
        params["page"] += 1
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        data = response.json()

        current_page = data["metadata"]["current_page"]
        results += data["results"]

    return results

# Usage example:
url = "https://api.example.com/endpoint"
params = {"page": 1, "limit": 10} 
all_results = fetch_all_results(url, params)
```

By using the `fetch_all_results()` function, you can easily handle pagination in API responses using Python and the Requests library. Remember to replace the `url` and `params` variables with the specific API details for your use case.

Happy coding!
