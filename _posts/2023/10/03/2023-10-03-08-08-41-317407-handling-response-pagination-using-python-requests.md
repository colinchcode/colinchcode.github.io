When working with APIs that return paginated responses, it's important to handle pagination in order to retrieve all the data. In this tutorial, we will explore how to handle response pagination using the popular Python library, Requests.

## Introduction

APIs often use pagination to split large data sets into smaller, more manageable chunks. Each response contains a limited number of items, along with metadata indicating the availability of more data. By making subsequent requests with the appropriate parameters, we can retrieve all the available data.

## Getting Started

To begin, we need to install the `requests` library using pip:

```python
pip install requests
```

Once installed, we can import the library in our Python script:

```python
import requests
```

## Pagination Headers

APIs typically use HTTP headers to provide information about pagination. The two most common headers used are:

- `Link`: Contains URLs for the next, previous, first, and last pages.
- `X-Total-Count`: Provides the total number of items available across all pages.

We can retrieve these headers using the `headers` attribute of the response object:

```python
response.headers['Link']
response.headers['X-Total-Count']
```

## Paginated Requests

To handle pagination, we use a loop to make subsequent requests until we have retrieved all the data. Here's an example:

```python
url = "https://api.example.com/data"
params = {'page': 1}

while True:
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    data = response.json()
    
    # Process the retrieved data here
    
    if 'Link' not in response.headers:
        break
        
    # Extract the URL for the next page
    next_page_url = parse_next_page_url(response.headers['Link'])
    
    # Update the 'page' parameter for the next request
    params['page'] += 1
    
    # Make the next request
    url = next_page_url
```

In the example above, we start by setting the initial page parameter to 1. We then enter a while loop that makes requests until there are no more pages available. Each response is parsed and the data is processed accordingly. If the 'Link' header is not present, it means we've reached the last page, and we break out of the loop. Otherwise, we extract the URL for the next page from the 'Link' header, update the 'page' parameter, and make the next request.

## Putting it all together

Let's combine all the concepts we've discussed to demonstrate a complete example:

```python
import requests
import urllib.parse as urlparse

def parse_next_page_url(link_header):
    links = link_header.split(', ')
    for link in links:
        if 'rel="next"' in link:
            url = link.split(';')[0].strip('<>')
            return urlparse.urljoin(url)
    return None

def process_data(data):
    # Process the retrieved data here
    pass

def handle_pagination(url, params):
    while True:
        response = requests.get(url, params=params)
        data = response.json()
        process_data(data)

        if 'Link' not in response.headers:
            break

        next_page_url = parse_next_page_url(response.headers['Link'])
        params['page'] += 1
        url = next_page_url

# Example usage
url = "https://api.example.com/data"
params = {'page': 1}

handle_pagination(url, params)
```

In this example, we've defined helper functions to parse the 'Link' header and process the retrieved data. By encapsulating the pagination logic in a separate function, we can easily reuse it for different endpoints.

## Conclusion

Handling pagination in API responses is essential when working with large data sets. The Python Requests library provides a simple and effective way to handle pagination by making subsequent requests with the appropriate parameters. By understanding the pagination headers and implementing a loop, we can easily retrieve all the available data from paginated APIs.
