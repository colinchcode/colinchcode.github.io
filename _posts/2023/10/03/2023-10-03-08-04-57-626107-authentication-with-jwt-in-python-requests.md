When working with web APIs, it is common to encounter authentication requirements. One popular authentication method is JSON Web Tokens (JWT). In this tutorial, we will learn how to perform authentication with JWT in Python Requests library.

## Introduction
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is widely used for authentication and authorization in modern web applications. JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.

Python Requests is a popular library for making HTTP requests. It provides a simple and intuitive way to interact with web APIs.

## Installing Dependencies
Before we get started, let's make sure we have the necessary dependencies installed. We need the `requests` and `PyJWT` libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

```shell
pip install requests PyJWT
```

## Generating a JWT
To authenticate with JWT, we need to generate a valid token. The token is typically obtained by providing valid credentials to an authentication server. For this example, let's assume we have a function `get_jwt_token` that returns a valid JWT token:

```python
import jwt

def get_jwt_token():
    payload = {'username': 'exampleuser', 'role': 'admin'}
    secret_key = 'secret'
    token = jwt.encode(payload, secret_key, algorithm='HS256')
    return token
```

Note that in a real-world scenario, the token generation process may involve contacting an authentication server or implementing a custom authentication mechanism.

## Making Authenticated Requests
Once we have a valid JWT token, we can use it to make authenticated requests. Here's an example of sending a GET request with authentication headers:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {get_jwt_token()}'}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

In this example, we set the `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer <TOKEN>` using a formatted string. Replace `<TOKEN>` with your generated token.

If the authentication is successful, the response will contain the data you requested. You can handle the response according to your application's needs.

That's it! Now you know how to authenticate with JWT in Python Requests. Remember to handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the authentication process and make sure to securely store your secret key.

Feel free to explore additional features of JWT and Requests to enhance your authentication workflow. Happy coding!
