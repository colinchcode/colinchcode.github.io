In this tutorial, we will learn how to implement the authorization code OAuth2 authentication in Python. OAuth2 is an open standard for authorization that allows users to grant access to their resources stored on one website to another website without sharing their credentials.

## What is OAuth2
OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's account on another website. It provides a secure and standardized way for users to grant permissions to other websites or applications to access their resources.

## Authorization Code Flow
The authorization code flow is one of the most widely used flows in OAuth2. It involves the following steps:

1. The user requests access to a protected resource on the client application.
2. The client application redirects the user to the authorization server where the user can log in and grant permissions.
3. The authorization server redirects the user back to the client application with an authorization code.
4. The client application exchanges the authorization code for an access token from the authorization server.
5. The client application can use the access token to access protected resources on behalf of the user.

## Implementing OAuth2 Authentication in Python

### Step 1: Install Required Libraries
Before we start implementing OAuth2 authentication in Python, let's make sure we have the necessary libraries installed. We will be using the `requests` library to make HTTP requests.

```python
pip install requests
```

### Step 2: Set Up OAuth2 Credentials
To use OAuth2 authentication, you need to obtain your client credentials from the provider (e.g., Google, Facebook). These credentials typically include a client ID and a client secret. Make sure to store these credentials securely and never share them publicly.

```python
client_id = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
client_secret = "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
redirect_uri = "http://localhost:8000/callback"
```

### Step 3: Redirect User for Authorization
To initiate the authorization process, we need to redirect the user to the authorization server's login page. The user will be prompted to grant permissions to our application.

```python
import requests

authorization_endpoint = "https://example.com/oauth2/authorize"
scope = "profile email"

# Construct the authorization URL
params = {
    "response_type": "code",
    "client_id": client_id,
    "redirect_uri": redirect_uri,
    "scope": scope,
}
authorization_url = authorization_endpoint + "?" + urllib.parse.urlencode(params)

# Redirect the user to the authorization URL
return redirect(authorization_url)
```

### Step 4: Handling the Authorization Callback
After the user grants permissions, the authorization server will redirect the user back to our application's redirect URI, along with an authorization code in the query parameters. We need to handle this callback and exchange the authorization code for an access token.

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/callback")
def callback():
    code = request.args.get("code")
    # Exchange the authorization code for an access token
    # ...

```

### Step 5: Obtaining Access Token
To obtain the access token, we need to make a POST request to the authorization server's token endpoint and provide the necessary parameters, including the authorization code, client credentials, and redirect URI.

```python
token_endpoint = "https://example.com/oauth2/token"

data = {
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "code": code,
    "client_id": client_id,
    "client_secret": client_secret,
    "redirect_uri": redirect_uri,
}

response = requests.post(token_endpoint, data=data)

if response.status_code == 200:
    access_token = response.json()["access_token"]
else:
    # Handle error response
```

### Step 6: Access Protected Resources
Once we have obtained the access token, we can use it to access protected resources on behalf of the user. The way we access these resources depends on the API provider.

```python
api_endpoint = "https://example.com/api/profile"

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer " + access_token,
}

response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)

if response.status_code == 200:
    profile_data = response.json()
else:
    # Handle error response
```

That's it! You have now successfully implemented authorization code OAuth2 authentication in Python.

Remember to secure your client credentials and handle any errors or exceptions that may arise during the authentication process.
