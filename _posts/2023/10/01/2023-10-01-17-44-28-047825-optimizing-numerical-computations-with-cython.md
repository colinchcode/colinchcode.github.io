When it comes to numerical computations, Python is not known for its outstanding performance. However, with the help of Cython, we can optimize our Python code to be as fast as C or even C++. Cython is a superset of Python that allows us to write C type declarations and access C libraries directly. In this blog post, we will look at how we can use Cython to optimize our numerical computations.

## What is Cython?

Cython is an optimizing static compiler for Python. It allows us to write code in a language that is almost a superset of Python and get C level performance. With Cython, we can compile Python-like code into C or C++ and then into an optimized binary. This allows us to achieve performance improvements for computationally-intensive tasks.

## Getting started

To get started with Cython, we need to install it first. We can install Cython using pip:

```shell
$ pip install cython
```

Once installed, we can start writing our Cython code.

## Writing Cython code

To write Cython code, we create a `.pyx` file that contains our code. This file will be compiled by the Cython compiler and generate a C or C++ file that can be further compiled into an optimized binary.

Let's take a look at a simple example of computing the sum of two arrays in Python and Cython.

### Python code

```python
def array_sum(a, b):
    return [x + y for x, y in zip(a, b)]
```

### Cython code

```python
import cython

@cython.boundscheck(False)
@cython.wraparound(False)
def array_sum(a, b):
    return [x + y for x, y in zip(a, b)]
```

In this example, we add two arrays element-wise using list comprehension. However, we also add two Cython annotations (`@cython.boundscheck(False)` and `@cython.wraparound(False)`) to disable the bounds checking and wraparound behavior. By doing this, we tell Cython that we are confident that our arrays will always have the correct bounds, which can significantly improve performance.

## Compiling and using Cython code

To compile our Cython code, we can create a `setup.py` file with the following content:

```python
from distutils.core import setup
from Cython.Build import cythonize

setup(
    ext_modules=cythonize("example.pyx")
)
```

And then, we can compile our code by running the following command:

```shell
$ python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

This will generate a compiled binary that we can import and use in our Python code:

```python
from example import array_sum

a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
result = array_sum(a, b)
print(result)
```

## Conclusion

Cython is a powerful tool that allows us to optimize our Python code and achieve C level performance. By using Cython, we can write Python-like code with C type declarations and access C libraries directly. This opens up new possibilities for optimizing numerical computations and computationally-intensive tasks. If you work with numerical data or scientific computing in Python, Cython is definitely worth exploring.
