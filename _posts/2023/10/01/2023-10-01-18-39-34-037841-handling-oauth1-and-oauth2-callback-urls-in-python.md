When working with OAuth1 and OAuth2 in Python, it is essential to understand how to handle the callback URLs. The callback URL, also known as the redirect URL, plays a vital role in the authentication flow, allowing the authorization server to redirect the user back to your application along with the authorization code or access token.

In this blog post, we will explore how to handle callback URLs for both OAuth1 and OAuth2 using Python.

## OAuth1 Callback URLs

In OAuth1, the callback URL needs to be registered with the service provider before initiating the authentication flow. The callback URL should be accessible by the OAuth provider and should handle the response. Here's how you can handle OAuth1 callback URLs using Flask and Django.

### Using Flask

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/oauth/callback", methods=["GET"])
def oauth_callback():
    oauth_token = request.args.get("oauth_token")
    oauth_verifier = request.args.get("oauth_verifier")
    
    # Handle the callback and obtain access token
    
    return "Logged in successfully!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Using Django

```python
from django.shortcuts import redirect, HttpResponse
from django.views import View

class OAuthCallbackView(View):

    def get(self, request):
        oauth_token = request.GET.get("oauth_token")
        oauth_verifier = request.GET.get("oauth_verifier")
        
        # Handle the callback and obtain access token
        
        return HttpResponse("Logged in successfully!")
```

## OAuth2 Callback URLs

In OAuth2, the callback URL is typically referred to as the redirect URI. Unlike OAuth1, there is no need to register the redirect URI with the service provider. Here's how you can handle OAuth2 callback URLs using Flask and Django.

### Using Flask

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/oauth/callback", methods=["GET"])
def oauth_callback():
    code = request.args.get("code")
    
    # Exchange the code for access token
    
    return "Logged in successfully!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

### Using Django

```python
from django.shortcuts import redirect, HttpResponse
from django.views import View

class OAuthCallbackView(View):

    def get(self, request):
        code = request.GET.get("code")
        
        # Exchange the code for access token
        
        return HttpResponse("Logged in successfully!")
```

Handling OAuth1 and OAuth2 callback URLs is crucial for successful authentication in your Python application. By following the examples provided, you can easily handle the callback URLs using popular web frameworks like Flask and Django.

Remember to register the correct callback URLs when setting up your OAuth applications with the respective service providers and ensure secure handling of the received authorization codes or access tokens.

That's it for handling OAuth1 and OAuth2 callback URLs in Python. Happy coding!
