OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows users to grant access to their data to third-party applications without exposing their credentials. There are two versions of OAuth - OAuth1 and OAuth2, each with a slightly different implementation. In this blog post, we will explore the basic working principles of both OAuth1 and OAuth2.

## OAuth1
OAuth1 is the older version of the OAuth protocol. It involves a three-step process to obtain access to protected resources.

### Requesting Access
- The application sends a request to the OAuth provider, along with the necessary credentials.
- The provider generates a temporary token and token secret, which are unique to the user and application.
- The temporary token and token secret are sent back to the application.

### Granting Access
- The application redirects the user to the OAuth provider's authorization page, passing the temporary token.
- The user logs in to the provider's website and grants permission to the application.
- The provider redirects the user back to the application, along with a verifier code.

### Accessing Protected Resources
- The application sends a request to the provider, including the verifier code and the temporary token.
- The provider verifies the code and token, and if valid, issues an access token and access token secret.
- The application can now use the access token and token secret to access the user's protected resources.

## OAuth2
OAuth2 is the successor to OAuth1 and has become the more widely adopted version. It simplifies the authentication process by eliminating the need for token secrets.

### Obtaining Authorization Code
- The application redirects the user to the OAuth provider's authorization page, passing client credentials and requested scopes.
- The user logs in to the provider's website and grants permission to the application.
- The provider redirects the user back to the application, along with an authorization code.

### Exchanging Authorization Code for Access Token
- The application sends a request to the provider, including the authorization code and client credentials.
- The provider verifies the code and credentials, and if valid, issues an access token.
- The application can now use the access token to access the user's protected resources.

### Accessing Protected Resources
- The application includes the access token in requests to the provider's API.
- The provider validates the access token and if valid, returns the requested resources.

In conclusion, both OAuth1 and OAuth2 provide authentication and authorization mechanisms to allow users to grant access to their data to third-party applications securely. OAuth1 uses temporary tokens and token secrets, while OAuth2 simplifies the process by using an authorization code and access token. It's important for developers to correctly implement the appropriate version of OAuth based on their requirements and the APIs they are working with.
