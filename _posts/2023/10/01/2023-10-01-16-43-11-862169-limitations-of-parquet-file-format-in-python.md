Parquet is a popular columnar storage file format that provides efficient data compression and encoding schemes, making it ideal for big data processing tasks. While Parquet has many benefits, it also has some limitations that users should be aware of when working with it in Python.

In this post, we will explore the limitations of the Parquet file format in Python and discuss how to work around them.

## 1. Limited support for schema evolution

One of the major limitations of Parquet in Python is its limited support for schema evolution. Schema evolution refers to modifying a schema over time while retaining existing data. Parquet files require a strictly defined schema, and any changes to the schema can cause issues when reading or writing data.

To work around this limitation, you can either use a more flexible file format like Apache Avro or define a new schema that is backward compatible with the existing data. However, modifying the schema in Parquet files can be challenging and may require careful planning and data migration.

## 2. Lack of support for random access

Another limitation of Parquet in Python is the lack of support for random access. Parquet files are optimized for columnar reading and writing, which means they are not designed for efficient random access operations.

If you need to perform random access operations on your data, such as querying specific rows or columns, you may need to consider using a different file format like Apache ORC or Apache Arrow.

## 3. No built-in indexing

Parquet files do not have built-in indexing capabilities in Python. This means that querying large Parquet datasets can be slower compared to formats that support indexing, such as Apache ORC.

To improve query performance, you can consider creating secondary indexes using external tools or frameworks like Apache Hive or Apache HBase.

## 4. Limited compatibility with certain data types

Parquet file format has limited compatibility with certain data types in Python. For example, complex nested data structures like sets or dictionaries may not be easily represented in Parquet files.

To work around this limitation, you can flatten your complex data structures into a more simple format before converting them to Parquet files. Alternatively, you can explore other file formats that provide better support for complex data types, such as Apache Avro.

## 5. Performance issues with small files

Parquet file format works best with large datasets. If you are working with small files, you may experience performance issues due to the overhead of columnar storage and compression.

To improve performance, you can consider combining small Parquet files into larger ones or using a different file format that is better suited for small files, such as Apache ORC or CSV.

In conclusion, while Parquet file format offers many advantages for big data processing, it also has some limitations in Python. By understanding these limitations and exploring alternative file formats when necessary, you can make informed decisions when working with Parquet files in Python.
