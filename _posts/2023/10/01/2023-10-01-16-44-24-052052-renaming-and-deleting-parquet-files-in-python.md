Parquet is a columnar storage file format that is commonly used for big data processing. In this blog post, we will discuss how to rename and delete Parquet files using Python.

## Renaming Parquet files

Renaming Parquet files can be done using the `os` module in Python. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to rename a Parquet file:

```python
import os

old_filename = 'old_file.parquet'
new_filename = 'new_file.parquet'

os.rename(old_filename, new_filename)
```

In the above code, we use the `os.rename()` function to rename the file. The function takes the old filename as the first parameter and the new filename as the second parameter.

## Deleting Parquet files

Deleting Parquet files can also be accomplished using the `os` module in Python. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to delete a Parquet file:

```python
import os

filename = 'file.parquet'

os.remove(filename)
```

In the above code, we use the `os.remove()` function to delete the file. The function takes the filename as the parameter.

It's important to note that once a Parquet file is deleted, it is permanently removed from the file system and cannot be recovered.

## Conclusion

Renaming and deleting Parquet files in Python is straightforward using the `os` module. By using these techniques, you can easily manage your Parquet files in your data processing pipelines.
