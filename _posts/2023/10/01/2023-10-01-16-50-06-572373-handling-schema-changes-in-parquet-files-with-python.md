Apache Parquet is a popular columnar storage file format used for big data processing. One of the challenges when working with Parquet files is handling schema changes. As the schema evolves over time, it can become challenging to read and process files with different versions of the schema.

In this blog post, we will explore how to handle schema changes in Parquet files using Python. We will leverage the `pyarrow` library, which provides a high-level API for working with Parquet files.

## Introduction
Parquet files are typically created with a well-defined schema that specifies the structure of the data. However, as new requirements arise, the schema may need to be modified. This can result in files with different versions of the schema, making it challenging to read and process the data.

When dealing with schema changes in Parquet files, we need to consider two scenarios:

1. **Adding new columns**: When a new column is added to the schema, the existing files may not have data for that column. 
2. **Changing column types**: When a column's data type is changed, it can lead to inconsistencies between files with different versions of the schema.

## Installing `pyarrow`
Before we proceed, let's install the `pyarrow` library using pip:

```bash
pip install pyarrow
```

## Reading Parquet files
To read Parquet files in Python, we can use the `pyarrow.parquet.read_table()` function. This function returns a `Table` object that represents the data in the Parquet file. 

```python
import pyarrow.parquet as pq

table = pq.read_table('data.parquet')

```

## Handling schema changes
To handle schema changes in Parquet files, we can leverage the capabilities of the `pyarrow.parquet` module. 

### Adding new columns
When adding new columns to the schema, the existing files may not have data for those columns. By default, reading a Parquet file with new columns will raise an error. To handle this situation, we can set the `use_legacy_dataset` parameter to `True`.

```python
table = pq.read_table('data.parquet', use_legacy_dataset=True)
```

### Changing column types
When the data type of a column is changed, it can result in inconsistencies between files with different versions of the schema. By default, `pyarrow` will raise an error if it encounters a type mismatch. To handle this, we can use the `schema_merging` option when reading Parquet files.

```python
table = pq.read_table('data.parquet', schema_merging='union')
```

## Conclusion
Handling schema changes in Parquet files is an essential aspect of working with big data. In this blog post, we explored how to handle schema changes using the `pyarrow` library in Python. We learned how to handle scenarios such as adding new columns or changing column types. By leveraging these techniques, you can effectively work with Parquet files that have different versions of the schema.

Remember to always consider the implications of schema changes and ensure that your data processing pipeline can handle them properly.
