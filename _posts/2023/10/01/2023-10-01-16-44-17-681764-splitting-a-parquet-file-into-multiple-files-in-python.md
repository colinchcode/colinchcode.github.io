Parquet is a columnar storage file format that is commonly used for big data processing. It is highly optimized for performance and offers several advantages over traditional row-based file formats like CSV or JSON. However, there may be situations where you need to split a Parquet file into multiple smaller files for various reasons, such as parallel processing or reducing file size. In this article, we will explore how to split a Parquet file into multiple files using Python.

## Requirements
To split a Parquet file into multiple files, we need the following dependencies:
- `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation library in Python.
- `pyarrow`: A Python library for working with Parquet files.

Ensure that you have these dependencies installed in your environment before proceeding.

## Splitting a Parquet file
To split a Parquet file into multiple files, we will use the pandas and pyarrow libraries in Python. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Import the required libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
import pyarrow.parquet as pq
```

2. Read the Parquet file into a pandas DataFrame:
```python
df = pd.read_parquet('path/to/parquet_file.parquet')
```

3. Determine the number of rows in the DataFrame and the desired number of rows per file:
```python
num_rows = len(df)
rows_per_file = 10000
```

4. Calculate the number of files needed based on the desired number of rows per file:
```python
num_files = num_rows // rows_per_file + 1
```

5. Split the DataFrame into multiple smaller DataFrames based on the desired number of rows per file:
```python
split_dataframes = [df[i:i+rows_per_file] for i in range(0, num_rows, rows_per_file)]
```

6. Save each smaller DataFrame as a separate Parquet file:
```python
for i, split_df in enumerate(split_dataframes):
    split_df.to_parquet(f'path/to/split_file_{i}.parquet', index=False)
```

That's it! You have successfully split the Parquet file into multiple smaller files. Each split file will have approximately the same number of rows based on the desired number of rows per file.

## Conclusion
Splitting a Parquet file into multiple files can be useful for various reasons, such as parallel processing or reducing file size. In this article, we learned how to split a Parquet file into multiple files using Python. By using the pandas and pyarrow libraries, we can easily accomplish this task. Feel free to adjust the desired number of rows per file according to your needs.
