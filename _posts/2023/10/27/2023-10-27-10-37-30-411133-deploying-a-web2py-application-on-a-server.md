Web2py is a powerful Python web framework that allows you to develop and deploy web applications with ease. Once you have developed your Web2py application, the next step is to deploy it on a server so that it can be accessed by users over the internet.

In this tutorial, we will walk you through the steps to deploy a Web2py application on a server.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have the following:
- A server with a supported operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows)
- Python installed on the server
- Basic knowledge of using the command line

## Step 1: Prepare the Server
First, you need to prepare your server by installing any necessary dependencies. This includes installing Python if it is not already installed on your server. You can follow the official documentation of the operating system to install Python.

## Step 2: Install Web2py
1. Begin by downloading the latest version of Web2py from the official website. You can either choose the source version or the pre-compiled binary depending on your preference.

2. Once downloaded, extract the Web2py package to a directory of your choice on the server.

## Step 3: Configure Web2py
1. Navigate to the Web2py directory on your server.

2. Open the `parameters_*.py` file in a text editor. Choose the appropriate version based on your deployment environment - `parameters_8080.py` for standalone, `parameters_8000.py` for production, or `parameters_443.py` for SSL/TLS.

3. Modify the necessary settings based on your requirements. For example, you might want to set the `password` parameter to secure your Web2py admin interface.

## Step 4: Start Web2py
1. Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the Web2py directory.

2. Run the following command to start Web2py:
```bash
python web2py.py
```

## Step 5: Access Your Application
Once Web2py is running, you can access your application by opening a web browser and entering the server's IP address or domain name followed by the port number (e.g., `http://your_server_ip:8000`). If you set up SSL/TLS, use `https` instead of `http`.

That's it! Your Web2py application is now deployed on the server and ready to be accessed by users.

Remember to configure your server to run Web2py as a service and ensure proper security measures to protect your application and server.

For more information and advanced deployment options, refer to the official Web2py documentation.
