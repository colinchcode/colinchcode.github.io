In Python, we can implement a simple range trading strategy using the `pandas` library for data analysis and the `matplotlib` library for visualization. Let's go through the steps to create a range trading strategy example.

First, we need to import the necessary libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Next, we need to retrieve historical price data of an asset. Assuming we have a CSV file with the price data, we can read it into a dataframe using `pandas`:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('price_data.csv')
```

We can then calculate the daily price range by subtracting the low price from the high price for each day:

```python
df['range'] = df['high'] - df['low']
```

Now, we can define the threshold values for the range. These values determine the range boundaries for our trading strategy:

```python
range_min = 10  # Minimum range value
range_max = 20  # Maximum range value
```

We can create a new column in the dataframe to indicate if the range for each day is within our defined threshold range or not:

```python
df['within_range'] = False
df.loc[(df['range'] >= range_min) & (df['range'] <= range_max), 'within_range'] = True
```

Finally, we can visualize the range trading strategy using a line chart. We can plot the closing price of the asset and highlight the days where the range is within the threshold range:

```python
plt.plot(df['date'], df['close'])
plt.scatter(df.loc[df['within_range'], 'date'], df.loc[df['within_range'], 'close'], color='red')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.title('Range Trading Strategy')
plt.show()
```

This will display a line chart with the closing price of the asset and red dots indicating the days where the range falls within the defined threshold.

Range trading strategies can be further enhanced by incorporating additional indicators, such as moving averages, to identify potential entry and exit points. It's important to note that this example is for educational purposes only, and proper risk management should be implemented when trading in real markets.
