Debugging code can be a challenge, especially when it involves external libraries. However, with the right approach and tools, you can effectively debug code that uses external libraries. In this blog post, we will explore some strategies and techniques for debugging code with external libraries using Python as an example.

## 1. Introduction

When working with external libraries, it is possible to encounter issues that are not directly related to your code but are instead caused by the underlying library. These issues could be due to incorrect usage of the library, compatibility issues, or even bugs within the library itself.

## 2. Understanding the Issue

The first step in debugging code that uses external libraries is to understand the issue at hand. This involves identifying the symptoms, reproducing the problem, and narrowing down the possible causes. To do this, you can start by asking yourself the following questions:

- What is the expected behavior?
- What is the actual behavior?
- When does the issue occur? Is it consistent or intermittent?
- Are there any error messages or stack traces?

## 3. Checking for Errors

One of the easiest ways to troubleshoot issues with external libraries is to check for any error messages or exceptions that are raised. These error messages can provide valuable information about what went wrong and where the issue occurred.

You can use try-except blocks to catch and handle these errors. This way, you can display more detailed error messages or perform specific actions based on the errors. For example:

```python
import external_library

try:
    # Code that uses the external library
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## 4. Using Print Statements

Print statements are a simple yet effective tool for debugging code with external libraries. By strategically placing print statements in your code, you can inspect the values of variables, identify the flow of execution, and pinpoint where the issue might be occurring.

```python
import external_library

# Code that uses the external library
print(variable)
```

By printing out relevant variables or values before and after library functions or method calls, you can gain insights into how the library is being used and whether the inputs and outputs are as expected.

## 5. Logging

Logging is a more advanced alternative to print statements that allows you to capture and store debugging information in a more structured way. Python's built-in logging library provides a flexible and configurable mechanism for logging messages.

You can configure the logging library to capture debug-level messages and save them to a file for later analysis. By using different log levels and loggers, you can control the amount of information that is logged and filter out noise.

```python
import logging
import external_library

logging.basicConfig(filename='debug.log', level=logging.DEBUG)

# Code that uses the external library
logging.debug(variable)
```

## 6. Using a Debugger

When dealing with complex issues or intricate logic, using a debugger can be extremely helpful. Debuggers allow you to step through your code line by line, inspect variables, and track the flow of execution. They often have features specifically designed for debugging code that uses external libraries.

Python's built-in debugger, `pdb`, is a popular choice. It allows you to set breakpoints, step through code, and interactively explore the state of your program. To use `pdb`, you can insert the following line of code where you want to start debugging:

```python
import pdb

pdb.set_trace()
```

## 7. Conclusion

Debugging code with external libraries can be challenging, but with the right strategies and tools, you can effectively troubleshoot and solve issues. Understanding the issue, checking for errors, using print statements, logging, and using a debugger are all valuable techniques that can help you understand and resolve problems with code that relies on external libraries.

By following these techniques and persisting in your debugging efforts, you can gain valuable insights into how the external library is behaving and resolve any issues that arise.
