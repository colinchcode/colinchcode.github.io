## Setting up Email Configuration

First, we need to configure the email settings in the Web2py application. Open the `models/db.py` file and add the following code snippet:

```python
mail.settings.server = 'smtp.gmail.com:587'
mail.settings.sender = 'your-email@gmail.com'
mail.settings.login = 'your-email@gmail.com:your-password'
```

Replace the placeholder values with your own Gmail SMTP server credentials.

## Sending Emails in Web2py

To send an email, create a new function in the `controllers/default.py` file. Here's an example of sending a welcome email to a user:

```python
def send_welcome_email(email):
    message = 'Welcome to our website!'
    mail.send(to=email, subject='Welcome', message=message)
    return 'Email sent successfully!'
```

In the above example, the `to` parameter specifies the recipient's email address, the `subject` sets the email subject line, and the `message` parameter contains the email content.

To call this function from another controller or view, import the `mail` object and invoke the `send_welcome_email` function:

```python
from gluon.tools import Mail

def index():
    mail = Mail()
    mail.send_welcome_email('user@example.com')
    return 'Hello World'
```

Don't forget to import the `Mail` class from `gluon.tools` and initialize a `mail` object before using it.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to implement email functionality in Web2py using the Gmail SMTP server. We configured the email settings and demonstrated how to send an email using the `mail` object. Email functionality adds a valuable communication channel to your Web2py application, enhancing user experience and engagement.
