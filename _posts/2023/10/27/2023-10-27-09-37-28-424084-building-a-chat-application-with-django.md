In this tutorial, we will go through the process of building a chat application using Django, a popular Python web framework. The chat application will allow users to send and receive real-time messages.

## Setting up the Django project

First, let's create a new Django project and set up the necessary configurations.

```bash
$ django-admin startproject chatapp
$ cd chatapp
```

Next, we need to create a new Django app within our project.

```bash
$ python manage.py startapp chat
```

Add the newly created app to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the `settings.py` file.

```python
# chatapp/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'chat',
    ...
]
```

## Creating the chat models

Now, let's define the models that we need for our chat application. We will have two models: `User` and `Message`.

```python
# chat/models.py
from django.db import models

class User(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    # Add any additional fields as per your requirements

class Message(models.Model):
    sender = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    receiver = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    content = models.TextField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

Remember to run the migrations to create the necessary database tables.

```bash
$ python manage.py makemigrations
$ python manage.py migrate
```

## Implementing the chat views

We will now create the views to handle the chat functionality. Let's start by defining the view for the chat page.

```python
# chat/views.py
from django.shortcuts import render

def chat(request):
    # Add code to retrieve chat history and other necessary data
    return render(request, 'chat/chat.html')
```

Next, let's create a view to handle sending messages.

```python
# chat/views.py
from django.shortcuts import redirect

def send_message(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        # Add code to save the message and update the chat history
        return redirect('chat')
```

## Adding the chat templates

Now, we need to create the HTML templates for our chat application.

Create a folder named `templates` in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist. Inside the `templates` folder, create another folder named `chat`. Create the following HTML files inside the `chat` folder:

- `chat.html`: This is the main chat page where users can view and send messages.
- `message.html`: This is a template for rendering individual chat messages.

In the `chat.html` file, you can add a form to send messages and a container to display the chat history.

## Enabling real-time communication

To enable real-time communication, we can use Django Channels, an extension that allows Django to handle WebSockets and other asynchronous protocols.

To install Django Channels, use the following command:

```bash
$ pip install channels
```

Next, we need to configure Channels in our Django project. Update the `settings.py` file as follows:

```python
# chatapp/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'channels',
    ...
]

ASGI_APPLICATION = 'chatapp.routing.application'
```

Create a new file named `routing.py` in the `chatapp` directory with the following content:

```python
# chatapp/routing.py
from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
from django.urls import path
from chat import consumers

application = ProtocolTypeRouter(
    {
        'http': get_asgi_application(),
        'websocket': AuthMiddlewareStack(
            URLRouter(
                [
                    path('ws/chat/', consumers.ChatConsumer.as_asgi()),
                ]
            )
        ),
    }
)
```

Finally, we need to create the `ChatConsumer` class in the `consumers.py` file inside the `chat` app directory. This class will handle the WebSocket connections.

```python
# chat/consumers.py
from channels.generic.websocket import AsyncWebsocketConsumer

class ChatConsumer(AsyncWebsocketConsumer):
    async def connect(self):
        # Add code to handle WebSocket connection

    async def disconnect(self, close_code):
        # Add code to handle WebSocket disconnection

    async def receive(self, text_data):
        # Add code to handle incoming WebSocket messages

    async def send_message(self, event):
        # Add code to send WebSocket messages to clients
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have explored the process of building a chat application with Django. We have covered setting up the project, creating the necessary models, implementing the views, adding the templates, and enabling real-time communication with Django Channels.
