Dependency parsing is a natural language processing technique that assigns syntactic dependency labels to words in a sentence. It helps in understanding the grammatical structure and relationships between the words.

SpaCy is a popular Python library for natural language processing tasks. It provides a powerful and efficient dependency parser that can be used to perform dependency parsing on text data.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use SpaCy's dependency parsing capability to parse sentences and extract meaningful information from them.

### Installation
To get started, we need to install SpaCy. You can install it using pip:

```shell
pip install spacy
```

We also need to download the language model for English. In this tutorial, we will be using the "en_core_web_sm" model.

```shell
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Example Code
Let's start by importing SpaCy and loading the English language model.

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
```

Now, let's define a function that takes a sentence as input, performs dependency parsing, and returns the parsed result.

```python
def parse_sentence(sentence):
    doc = nlp(sentence)
    
    for token in doc:
        print(token.text, token.pos_, token.dep_, token.head.text)
```

We can now call this function to parse a sentence.

```python
sentence = "The cat is sitting on the mat."
parse_sentence(sentence)
```

The above code will output the dependency parse tree for the given sentence, where each word is printed along with its part-of-speech tag, dependency label, and the head word it is dependent on.

### Output
The output of the above code will be:

```
The DET det cat
cat NOUN nsubj sitting
is AUX aux sitting
sitting VERB ROOT sitting
on ADP prep sitting
the DET det mat
mat NOUN pobj on
. PUNCT punct sitting
```

### Conclusion
SpaCy provides an easy-to-use and efficient dependency parser for performing dependency parsing on text data. It allows us to parse sentences and extract valuable information about the grammatical structure and relationships between words.
