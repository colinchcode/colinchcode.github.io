## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to build a blog application using Django, a popular Python web framework. We will cover the necessary steps to create a blog model, implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, and display blog posts on a web page.

## Setting up the Django Project

To start, we need to install Django. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install django
```

Next, create a new Django project by running:

```bash
django-admin startproject blog_app
```

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd blog_app
```

## Creating the Blog Model

In Django, models define the structure of the database. Create a new file called `models.py` inside the `blog` app directory (create the `blog` app if it doesn't exist already). Add the following code to define our `Blog` model:

```python
from django.db import models

class Blog(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    content = models.TextField()
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

This model represents a blog post with a title, content, and timestamps for creation and updates.

To create the database table for this model, run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## Implementing CRUD Functionality

Now, let's add CRUD functionality to our blog application.

### Create a new blog post

To create a new blog post, we need a form to gather input from the user. Create a new file called `forms.py` inside the `blog` app directory and add the following code:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Blog

class BlogForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Blog
        fields = ['title', 'content']
```

Next, create a new view function in `views.py` to handle the form submission:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import BlogForm

def create_blog(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = BlogForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('blog:home')
    else:
        form = BlogForm()
    return render(request, 'blog/create_blog.html', {'form': form})
```

Add the corresponding URL pattern in the `urls.py` file inside the `blog` app directory:

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

app_name = 'blog'

urlpatterns = [
    path('create/', views.create_blog, name='create'),
]
```

### Read, Update, and Delete blog posts

To read, update, and delete blog posts, we need to implement the corresponding views and URL patterns similar to the create functionality. Refer to the official Django documentation for more details on how to implement these operations.

## Displaying Blog Posts

To display the blog posts on a web page, we need to create a view and a corresponding HTML template. Create a new file called `home.html` inside the `templates/blog` directory and add the following code:

```html
{% raw %}
<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<ul>
  {% for blog in blogs %}
  <li>
    <h3>{{ blog.title }}</h3>
    <p>{{ blog.content }}</p>
    <p>Created at: {{ blog.created_at }}</p>
    <p>Updated at: {{ blog.updated_at }}</p>
  </li>
  {% empty %}
  <li>No blog posts yet.</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
{% endraw %}
```

Next, in `views.py`, create a new view function to render the home page:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Blog

def home(request):
    blogs = Blog.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'blog/home.html', {'blogs': blogs})
```

Finally, add the URL pattern in the `urls.py` file in your project directory:

```python
from django.urls import path
from blog.views import home

urlpatterns = [
    path('blog/', include('blog.urls')),
    path('', home, name='home'),
]
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build a blog application using Django. We covered the steps to set up a Django project, create a blog model, implement CRUD functionality, and display blog posts on a web page. With this foundation, you can now expand and enhance your blog application to suit your needs. Happy coding!
