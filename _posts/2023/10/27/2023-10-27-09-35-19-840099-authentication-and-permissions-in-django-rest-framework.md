One of the key components of building secure web applications is implementing authentication and permissions. Django REST framework provides a comprehensive solution to handle authentication and permissions for your API.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user. Django REST framework offers various authentication methods out of the box, including session authentication, token authentication, and OAuth authentication.

### Session Authentication

Session authentication is similar to the authentication used in Django views. It relies on Django's session framework and uses a session cookie to authenticate requests. To enable session authentication in your Django REST framework, you need to add the `SessionAuthentication` class to your authentication classes.

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

### Token Authentication

Token authentication involves issuing a token to the user after they provide valid credentials. The token is then included in subsequent requests as a header or as a query parameter to authenticate the user. To enable token authentication in Django REST framework, you need to add the `TokenAuthentication` class to your authentication classes.

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication',
        ...
    ],
    ...
}
```

### OAuth Authentication

OAuth is a popular protocol for delegating access to resources without sharing credentials. Implementing OAuth authentication in Django REST framework involves integrating with a third-party OAuth provider, such as Facebook, Google, or GitHub. The `OAuthAuthentication` class handles the authentication flow with the OAuth provider.

## Permissions

Once the user is authenticated, you need to enforce permissions to restrict access to certain resources or actions. Django REST framework offers a wide range of permission classes to control access to your API.

### `IsAuthenticated` and `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly`

The `IsAuthenticated` permission class ensures that the user making the request is authenticated. `IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly` allows read-only requests even if the user is not authenticated.

```python
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly

class MyView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly]
```

### Model-Level Permissions

Django REST framework allows you to define custom permissions on a per-model basis. You can specify permission classes within your serializers or viewsets.

```python
from rest_framework import permissions

class MyModelViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAdminUser]
```

### Object-Level Permissions

In addition to model-level permissions, you can also implement object-level permissions to further restrict access based on the specific object being accessed. 

```python
from rest_framework import permissions

class IsOwner(permissions.BasePermission):
    def has_object_permission(self, request, view, obj):
        return obj.owner == request.user

class MyModelViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    permission_classes = [IsOwner]
```

These are just a few examples of the authentication and permissions features provided by Django REST framework. You can explore the official Django REST framework documentation for more advanced scenarios and authentication backend options.
