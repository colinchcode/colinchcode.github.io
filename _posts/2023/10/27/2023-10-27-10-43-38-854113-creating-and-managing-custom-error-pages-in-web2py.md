## Why Custom Error Pages

By default, when a user encounters an error on your website, Web2py displays a generic error page. While this page provides some information about the error, it may not provide a personalized experience for your users. Custom error pages allow you to design and display error messages that match the branding and design of your website, helping to maintain a consistent user experience.

## Creating Custom Error Pages

To create a custom error page in Web2py, you need to create a view file for each error code you want to handle. For example, to handle a 404 error, you would create a view file named `error404.html` in the `views` directory of your application.

In the `error404.html` file, you can design the error page using HTML, CSS, and Web2py templating language. You can include any content you want, such as an apology message, a search form, or links to popular pages. Here's an example of a simple custom 404 error page:

```html
<h1>Oops! Page Not Found</h1>
<p>We're sorry, but the page you requested could not be found.</p>
```

You can create custom error pages for other error codes like 500 (Internal Server Error), 403 (Forbidden), and so on, following the same naming convention (e.g., `error500.html`, `error403.html`).

## Handling Custom Error Pages

After creating the custom error pages, you need to configure Web2py to use them. Open the `routes.py` file in the root directory of your Web2py application.

In the `routes.py` file, you can define specific actions or controllers to handle different error codes. For example, to handle the 404 error code, add the following line:

```python
routes_onerror[404] = URL('default', 'error404')
```

This line tells Web2py to redirect any 404 error to the `error404` view inside the `default` controller.

You can do the same for other error codes by adding more lines to the `routes_onerror` dict.

## Conclusion

Custom error pages are an essential part of any web application as they provide a user-friendly and personalized experience when errors occur. With Web2py, creating and managing custom error pages is straightforward, allowing you to design error pages that align with your application's branding and design.

In this blog post, we discussed how to create and handle custom error pages in Web2py. We explored the process of creating custom error pages using HTML and Web2py templating language and configuring Web2py to redirect specific error codes to the corresponding custom error pages.

With custom error pages, you can enhance the user experience on your website by providing clear and helpful error messages. Happy coding!
