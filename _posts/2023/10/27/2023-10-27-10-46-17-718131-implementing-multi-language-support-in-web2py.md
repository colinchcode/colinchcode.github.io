Web2py is a versatile web framework for building scalable and secure web applications. One of its powerful features is the built-in support for multi-language applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement multi-language support in a Web2py application.

## Introduction to multi-language support in Web2py

Multi-language support allows users to view the application content in different languages based on their preferences. With Web2py, you can easily implement this feature by leveraging its localization capabilities.

## Setting up the application for multi-language support

To enable multi-language support in a Web2py application, you need to define the supported languages and configure the application settings accordingly. 

1. Open the `models/db.py` file in your Web2py application.
2. Add the following line at the beginning of the file to import the necessary modules:

```python
from gluon.tools import Mail
```

3. Add the following lines to define the supported languages and configure the `T` object:

```python
# Define the supported languages
supported_languages = ['en', 'fr', 'es']

# Configure T object for translation
T.force('en')
T.accepted_language = lambda l: supported_languages if l in supported_languages else 'en'
```

The above code sets up the `T` object to use English (`en`) as the default language and falls back to English if the requested language is not supported.

## Creating language-specific views

To provide language-specific content, you need to create separate views for each supported language. 

1. In the application's `views` folder, create a new folder named `languages`.
2. Inside the `languages` folder, create subfolders for each supported language, using the language code as the folder name (e.g., `en`, `fr`, `es`).
3. Place the corresponding view files inside each language folder, with the same name as the original view file, but with the language code appended to the filename (e.g., `index_fr.html`, `index_es.html`).

When a user visits the application, Web2py automatically selects the appropriate language based on the user's preferences and loads the corresponding view file.

## Translating the content

To translate the content displayed in the views, you can use the `T()` function provided by Web2py. The `T()` function takes a string as an argument and returns the translated string based on the current language setting.

Here's an example of how to use the `T()` function in your views:

```python
{% raw %}
<h1>{{=T('Welcome to my website')}}</h1>
<p>{{=T('This is my about page')}}</p>
{% endraw %}
```

In the above code, the strings inside the `T()` function will be automatically translated based on the selected language.

You can also provide translation strings with variables:

```python
{% raw %}
<h1>{{=T('Welcome to my website, %(name)s', name='John')}}</h1>
{% endraw %}
```

The `T()` function will substitute the placeholder `%(name)s` with the value provided.

## Switching between languages

To allow users to switch between different languages, you can add a language selector in your application's user interface. 

1. In your main layout file (e.g., `views/layout.html`), add a language selector with links or buttons for each supported language.
2. Set the language code as a query variable or in the session when a user selects a language.
3. In your controller, handle the language selection and update the `T` object accordingly:

```python
def set_language():
    session.language = request.vars.lang
    T.force(session.language or 'en')
    redirect(request.env.http_referer)
```

In the above code, the `set_language` function stores the selected language in the session and updates the `T` object to use the new language. Finally, it redirects the user back to the previous page.

## Conclusion

Implementing multi-language support in a Web2py application is straightforward thanks to its built-in localization features. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily create a multi-language application that provides a localized experience to your users.
