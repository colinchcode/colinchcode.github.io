Before we proceed with the installation, make sure your system meets the following prerequisites:

- Python 2.7 or Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- An internet connection to download the necessary files.

1. Open your command prompt or terminal.

2. Install Web2py using pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install web2py
```

3. Once the installation is complete, you can verify it by importing web2py in Python:

```python
import web2py
```

If no errors occur, then Web2py has been successfully installed on your system.

## Running the Web2py Server<a name="running-the-web2py-server"></a>

To run the Web2py server and start developing web applications, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your Web2py project.

2. Run the following command to create a new Web2py application:

```python
python web2py.py -a your_password -c your_app_name
```

Replace `your_password` with a password of your choice and `your_app_name` with the name you want to give to your application. This command will create a new directory with the same name as your application.

3. Change directory into the application's folder:

```python
cd your_app_name
```

4. Start the Web2py server:

```python
python web2py.py
```

By default, the server runs on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to access the Web2py administration interface.
