Web2py is a powerful Python web framework that makes it easy to develop web applications. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement geolocation and mapping features in a Web2py application.

## Setting Up
First, let's set up a basic Web2py application. Install Web2py by following the instructions from the [official documentation](http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download).

Once you have Web2py installed, create a new application using the following command:
```
python web2py.py -S myapp
```

Replace `myapp` with the name of your application.

## Getting User's Location
To obtain the user's location, we can use the HTML5 Geolocation API. This allows us to access the user's current position directly from their device.

In your Web2py application, create a new controller and action, for example `default/index`, and include the following code:
```python
def index():
    return dict()
```

In the corresponding view file `myapp/views/default/index.html`, add the following JavaScript code to retrieve the user's location and display it:
```html
<script>
    function showPosition(position) {
        var latitude = position.coords.latitude;
        var longitude = position.coords.longitude;
        document.getElementById("location").innerHTML = "Latitude: " + latitude + ", Longitude: " + longitude;
    }

    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
    } else {
        document.getElementById("location").innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
    }
</script>

<div id="location"></div>
```

When the user visits the page, their location will be displayed in the `location` div.

## Showing User's Location on a Map
To display the user's location on a map, we can use a popular mapping library like Leaflet. Leaflet is a lightweight library that provides a simple and intuitive API for mapping.

First, include the Leaflet library by adding the following line to the head section of your view file (`myapp/views/default/index.html`):
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/leaflet@1.7.1/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
```

Next, add a `<div>` element with a specific id to display the map. Replace the existing `location` div with the following code:
```html
<div id="map" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;"></div>
```

Finally, modify the `showPosition()` function to show the user's location on the map using Leaflet:
```javascript
function showPosition(position) {
    var latitude = position.coords.latitude;
    var longitude = position.coords.longitude;

    var map = L.map('map').setView([latitude, longitude], 13);

    L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
        attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    }).addTo(map);

    L.marker([latitude, longitude]).addTo(map).bindPopup("Your location").openPopup();
}
```

Now, when the user visits the page, they will see a map with a marker indicating their current location.

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we explored how to implement geolocation and mapping features in a Web2py application. We learned how to obtain the user's location using the HTML5 Geolocation API and how to display it on a map using Leaflet. Adding geolocation and mapping capabilities opens up a whole new range of possibilities for your Web2py applications, such as location-based services and personalized experiences for your users. 

Feel free to enhance and customize the code to fit your specific requirements. Happy coding!
