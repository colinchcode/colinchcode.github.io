Web2py is a Python framework for building web applications. It provides a convenient way to handle URL routing, allowing you to map URLs to specific actions or controllers in your application. In this blog post, we will explore how to create and manage custom routes in Web2py. Let's get started!

## Introduction
URL routing is an essential aspect of developing web applications. It allows you to define the structure of your website's URLs and map them to different sections or actions in your application. By using custom routes, you can have more control over how your URLs are structured and provide a better user experience.

## Defining Routes
To define a custom route in Web2py, you need to modify the `routes.py` file located in the `models` directory of your project. In this file, you can map a URL pattern to a specific controller or action in your application.

Here's an example of how to define a custom route that maps the URL `/about` to the `about` action of the `default` controller:

```python
# models/routes.py

# Map /about URL to default/about controller/action
routes_in = (
    ("/about", "/default/about")
)
```

In this example, whenever a user visits the `/about` URL, Web2py will execute the `about` action of the `default` controller.

## Managing Routes
Web2py provides different options for managing routes, depending on your requirements. Let's explore two common scenarios below.

### Routing to Controllers
By default, Web2py maps URLs to controllers and actions based on their directory structure and filename. However, you can override this behavior by defining custom routes.

To route to a specific controller and action using a custom URL, you can use the `to` keyword. Here's an example:

```python
# models/routes.py

# Map /products URL to the products controller and index action
routes_in = (
    ("/products", "/products/default/index"),
)
```

In this example, when a user visits the `/products` URL, Web2py will execute the `index` action of the `default` controller in the `products` directory.

### Routing to Static Files
In addition to routing to controllers and actions, you can also route URLs to static files, such as CSS or JavaScript files. This can be useful when you want to keep your assets organized in separate directories.

To route to a static file, you can use the `static` keyword. Here's an example:

```python
# models/routes.py

# Map /static/css/main.css URL to the main.css file in the static/css directory
routes_in = (
    ("/static/css/main.css", "/static/css/main.css"),
)
```

In this example, when a user requests the `/static/css/main.css` URL, Web2py will serve the `main.css` file located in the `static/css` directory.

## Conclusion
Custom routes in Web2py allow you to have more control over your application's URL structure. By defining custom routes, you can route URLs to specific controllers, actions, or even static files. This enables you to create clean and user-friendly URLs for your web application.

In this blog post, we've covered the basics of creating and managing custom routes in Web2py. We've seen how to define routes in the `routes.py` file and route to controllers or static files. By leveraging these capabilities, you can enhance the routing experience in your Web2py applications.
