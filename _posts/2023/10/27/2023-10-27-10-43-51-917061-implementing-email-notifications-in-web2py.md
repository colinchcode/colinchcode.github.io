Web2py is a powerful web framework that allows you to easily build web applications. One common requirement in web applications is the ability to send email notifications to users. In this article, we will walk through the process of implementing email notifications in a Web2py application using the built-in `Email` class.

## Setting up email configuration

Before we can send email notifications, we need to configure the email settings in our Web2py application. This can be done by modifying the `models/db.py` file.

Open the `models/db.py` file and locate the `db.define_table()` function. Add the following lines of code inside this function:

```python
from gluon.tools import Mail

mail = Mail()
mail.settings.server = 'smtp.gmail.com:587'
mail.settings.sender = 'your_email@gmail.com'
mail.settings.login = 'your_email@gmail.com:your_password'
```

In the code above, we are configuring the email settings to use Gmail's SMTP server. Replace `'your_email@gmail.com'` with your actual Gmail email address and `'your_password'` with your Gmail account password.

## Sending email notifications

Now that we have configured the email settings, we can proceed with sending email notifications. In your controller file, import the `mail` object from the `models/db.py` file:

```python
from .models.db import mail
```

To send an email notification, you can use the `mail.send()` method. Here's an example of sending a simple email notification:

```python
def send_notification():
    subject = 'Hello from Web2py'
    body = 'This is a test email notification'
    recipient = 'recipient_email@example.com'

    mail.send(to=recipient, subject=subject, message=body)
```

In the code above, we specify the recipient, subject, and body of the email. We then use the `mail.send()` method to send the email.

You can also send HTML emails by specifying the `html` parameter in the `mail.send()` method:

```python
def send_html_notification():
    subject = 'Hello from Web2py'
    body = '<h1>This is a test HTML email notification</h1>'
    recipient = 'recipient_email@example.com'

    mail.send(to=recipient, subject=subject, message=body, html=True)
```

In this example, the `body` parameter contains HTML markup, and we set the `html` parameter to `True` to indicate that this is an HTML email.

## Conclusion

Implementing email notifications in a Web2py application is straightforward using the built-in `Email` class. By properly configuring the email settings and using the `mail.send()` method, you can easily send email notifications to users. Email notifications are a great way to keep users updated and engaged with your web application.
