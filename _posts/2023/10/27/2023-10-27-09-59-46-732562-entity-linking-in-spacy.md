Entity linking is the task of connecting mentions of named entities in text to their corresponding entities in a knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. SpaCy, a popular NLP library, provides functionalities to perform entity linking and extract useful information from text.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use SpaCy's entity linking features to link named entities to their Wikipedia pages. We will be using Python and SpaCy version 3.x.

## What is Entity Linking?

Entity linking is the process of disambiguating named entities by linking them to a unique identifier in a knowledge base. It helps in resolving mentions of ambiguous or polysemous entities and provides more context and information about them.

For example, given the sentence "I recently watched The Avengers", entity linking can link the named entity "The Avengers" to its corresponding Wikipedia page, providing additional information about the movie.

## How does Entity Linking work in SpaCy?

SpaCy uses the concept of knowledge bases to perform entity linking. A knowledge base contains information about entities like their names, aliases, descriptions, and identifiers. SpaCy supports knowledge bases in the JSON format, making it easy to extend or customize the existing knowledge bases.

By default, SpaCy provides the "Wikipedia" knowledge base, which links named entities to Wikipedia pages. While SpaCy's default knowledge base is pre-trained and works well for many use cases, it is possible to train and add custom knowledge bases if required.

## Setting up the Environment

To get started, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can install SpaCy and the Wikipedia knowledge base using the following commands:

```
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download en_wikipedia
```

## Performing Entity Linking in SpaCy

Once you have the required packages installed, you can perform entity linking using the following steps:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
# Add the 'entity_linker' component to the pipeline
nlp.add_pipe("entity_linker")

# Process the text
text = "I recently watched The Avengers"
doc = nlp(text)

# Iterate over each named entity in the document
for ent in doc.ents:
    # Check if the named entity has a Wikipedia URL, i.e., it's linked to an entity
    if ent._.kb_ents:
        # Get the Wikipedia URL for the linked entity
        wikipedia_url = ent._.kb_ents[0].url
        print(f"Entity: {ent}, Wikipedia URL: {wikipedia_url}")
```

In the code above, we load the SpaCy English model, add the "entity_linker" component to the pipeline, and process the text. We then iterate over each named entity in the document and check if it is linked to an entity. If it is linked, we print the entity and its corresponding Wikipedia URL.

## Extracting Information from the Linked Entities

SpaCy's entity linking not only provides the Wikipedia URL for linked entities but also allows us to extract additional information such as aliases, descriptions, and entity types. Here is an example of how to extract such information:

```python
for ent in doc.ents:
    if ent._.kb_ents:
        entity_linking_info = ent._.kb_ents[0]
        aliases = entity_linking_info.aliases
        description = entity_linking_info.description
        entity_type = entity_linking_info.entity_type

        print(f"Entity: {ent}")
        print(f"Aliases: {aliases}")
        print(f"Description: {description}")
        print(f"Entity Type: {entity_type}")
```

By accessing the properties of the linked entity, we can gather more information about it, such as alternative names, a brief description, and the entity type.

## Conclusion

Entity linking is a crucial task in natural language processing, and SpaCy provides an easy-to-use interface for performing entity linking and extracting valuable information from named entities. In this blog post, we have explored how to use SpaCy's entity linking features and extract information from linked entities.
