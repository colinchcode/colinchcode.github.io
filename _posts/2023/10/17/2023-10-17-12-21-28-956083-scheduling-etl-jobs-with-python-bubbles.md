ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs are an essential part of data processing pipelines. They help extract data from various sources, apply transformations, and load it into a target destination. One challenge in ETL is scheduling these jobs to run at specific intervals automatically. Fortunately, Python provides several libraries and frameworks that can help with job scheduling, one of which is Python Bubbles.

## What is Python Bubbles?

Python Bubbles is a lightweight job scheduling library that allows you to schedule and run Python functions or scripts at specific time intervals. It is built on top of the APScheduler library and provides a simplified API for easier job scheduling.

## Installation

To install Python Bubbles, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install python-bubbles
```

## Basic usage

Using Python Bubbles is straightforward. Let's start by scheduling a basic ETL job to run every hour. First, import the necessary classes:

```python
from bubbles import Job, Scheduler
```

Create a new job by defining a Python function that represents your ETL job:

```python
def etl_job():
    # Your ETL logic goes here
    print("Running ETL job...")
    # Perform data extraction, transformation, and loading tasks
```

Next, initialize a scheduler instance:

```python
scheduler = Scheduler()
```

Schedule the job to run every hour:

```python
scheduler.schedule(Job(etl_job), seconds=3600)
```

Finally, start the scheduler:

```python
scheduler.start()
```

This will start the scheduler and trigger the ETL job every hour.

## Advanced usage

Python Bubbles supports more advanced scheduling options. You can specify the job to run at specific dates or times, multiple times per day, or with custom cron expressions. You can also specify the start and end dates for job execution.

Here's an example of scheduling a job to run every day at a specific time:

```python
scheduler.schedule(Job(etl_job), days=1, start_time="9:00")
```

And here's an example of scheduling a job to run multiple times per day:

```python
scheduler.schedule(Job(etl_job), minutes=[0, 15, 30, 45])
```

## Conclusion

Python Bubbles provides a simple yet powerful way to schedule ETL jobs in Python. With its intuitive API, you can easily schedule your jobs to run at specific intervals or times. Whether you need to run your ETL jobs hourly, daily, or even multiple times per day, Python Bubbles has got you covered.

Give it a try and explore more of its advanced features to enhance your ETL workflows.
