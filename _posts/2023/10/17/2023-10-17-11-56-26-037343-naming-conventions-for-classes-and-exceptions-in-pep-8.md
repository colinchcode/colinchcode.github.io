In Python, following a consistent naming convention is important for code readability and maintainability. PEP 8, the official Python style guide, provides guidelines for naming classes and exceptions.

### Class Names

According to PEP 8, class names should use the [CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) convention, where each word starts with an uppercase letter without any underscores between words. This convention makes class names easier to read and distinguishes them from variables or functions.

Example of good class name:

```python
class MyClass:
    pass
```

### Exception Names

When creating custom exceptions, PEP 8 suggests using the same naming convention as classes. Exception names should also use CamelCase and avoid underscores.

Example of good exception name:

```python
class MyCustomException(Exception):
    pass
```

### Module-Level Exceptions

For exceptions that are only used within a single module, PEP 8 recommends adding a suffix of "Error" to the exception class name.

Example of module-level exception name:

```python
class MyModuleSpecificExceptionError(Exception):
    pass
```

### Avoid Using Namespaces

In general, it is advisable to avoid using namespaces in class or exception names unless it is necessary for clarification. Namespaces can make code harder to read and should be used sparingly.

### Conclusion

Following the naming conventions outlined in PEP 8 for classes and exceptions helps to maintain a consistent and readable codebase. Using CamelCase for class and exception names without underscores provides clarity and enhances code maintainability.
