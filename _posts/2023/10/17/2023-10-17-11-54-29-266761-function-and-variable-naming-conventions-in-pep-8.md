In the Python programming language, following a consistent naming convention for functions and variables is important to enhance code readability and maintainability. The official style guide for Python, known as PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8), provides guidelines for naming conventions.

Let's take a look at some of the key recommendations for function and variable naming in PEP 8:

## Function Names

1. Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (`snake_case`).
2. Be concise and descriptive when naming functions.
3. Use verbs or verb phrases for function names to indicate actions.

For example:

```python
def calculate_total_price():  # Good
    pass

def get_user_details():  # Good
    pass

def perform_login():  # Good
    pass

def retrieve_data():  # Avoid using generic names like 'data'
    pass
```

## Variable Names

1. Use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (`snake_case`).
2. Be meaningful and descriptive when naming variables.
3. Avoid using single characters (`x`, `y`, `i`, etc.), except for simple counter variables in loops.
4. Use lowercase for constants, but use uppercase letters if they span multiple words (`ALL_CAPS`).
5. Avoid using built-in function or module names for variables.

For example:

```python
username = "john_doe"  # Good
total_amount = 100.50  # Good
num_files = 25  # Good

x = 10  # Acceptable in simple loops
y = 20  # Acceptable in simple loops

PI = 3.14159  # Good for constants
MAX_CONNECTIONS = 100  # Good for constants

list = [1, 2, 3]  # Avoid using 'list' as a variable name
```

It's important to note that these naming conventions are just recommendations, and you are free to choose your own style. However, adhering to PEP 8 conventions helps maintain consistency across Python projects and makes your code more readable and accessible to other developers.

For a more detailed overview of PEP 8 naming conventions, you can refer to the official PEP 8 style guide: [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names).

By following these guidelines, you can write clean and well-structured Python code that is easier to understand and maintain. Happy coding!
