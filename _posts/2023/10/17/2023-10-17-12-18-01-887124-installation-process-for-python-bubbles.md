## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python (version 3.6 or later) installed on your machine.
- pip, Python's package installer, installed. You can check if it's installed by running `pip --version` in your terminal or command prompt.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

To install Python Bubbles, simply use pip by running the following command:

```python
pip install python-bubbles
```

This command will download and install the Python Bubbles library and its dependencies.

## Usage<a name="usage"></a>

Once Python Bubbles is installed, you can start using it in your Python scripts or notebooks.

Here's a simple example that creates a bubble chart using Python Bubbles:

```python
import bubbles

data = [
    {"x": 1, "y": 10, "size": 20, "color": "red", "label": "Point A"},
    {"x": 2, "y": 5, "size": 10, "color": "blue", "label": "Point B"},
    {"x": 3, "y": 8, "size": 15, "color": "green", "label": "Point C"},
]

chart = bubbles.BubbleChart(data)
chart.show()
```

In this example, we create a bubble chart by providing a list of dictionaries as data. Each dictionary represents a bubble, with keys for x and y coordinates, size, color, and label. We then create an instance of the `BubbleChart` class and call the `show()` method to display the chart.

You can customize various aspects of the chart, such as the axis labels, colors, and sizes. Please refer to the Python Bubbles documentation for more information on how to use and customize the library.

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

Python Bubbles is a fantastic library for creating interactive visualizations in Python. In this tutorial, we covered the installation process and provided a simple example of creating a bubble chart. Feel free to explore the library further and create beautiful visualizations for your data.
