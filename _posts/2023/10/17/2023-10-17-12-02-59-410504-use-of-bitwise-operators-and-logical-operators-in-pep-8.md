Python provides a set of bitwise operators and logical operators that can be used to manipulate and evaluate binary values. These operators are useful in scenarios where you need to perform operations at a bit level or evaluate conditions involving multiple binary values. PEP 8 provides guidelines for using these operators in a clear and consistent manner in Python code.

## Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators perform operations at the bit level on binary numbers. They are often used in scenarios such as data encoding, bit manipulation, and low-level programming. Here are the bitwise operators available in Python:

- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: Returns a binary value where each bit is set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in both operands are 1.
- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Returns a binary value where each bit is set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1.
- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Returns a binary value where each bit is set to 1 only if the corresponding bits in the operands are different.
- **Bitwise NOT (`~`)**: Returns the complement of a binary value by flipping all the bits.
- **Bitwise left shift (`<<`)**: Shifts the bits of the first operand left by the number of positions specified in the second operand.
- **Bitwise right shift (`>>`)**: Shifts the bits of the first operand right by the number of positions specified in the second operand.

When using bitwise operators, it's important to follow the guidelines outlined in PEP 8 to ensure code readability and maintainability. Here are some key guidelines to keep in mind:

- Use parentheses to group bitwise operations if necessary, to make the code more readable. For example, `result = (a & b) | c` instead of `result = a & b | c`.

- Avoid using bitwise 'NOT' (`~`) operator when it can be replaced with more readable alternatives. For example, use `x == 0` instead of `~x` to check if `x` is equal to zero.

- Avoid using bitwise operators to perform arithmetic operations. Instead, use the built-in arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /) for clarity and ease of understanding.

## Logical Operators

Logical operators perform operations based on the boolean values of the operands. They evaluate boolean expressions and return a boolean value as a result. The following logical operators are available in Python:

- **Logical AND (`and`)**: Returns `True` only if all the operands are `True`.
- **Logical OR (`or`)**: Returns `True` if at least one of the operands is `True`.
- **Logical NOT (`not`)**: Returns the opposite boolean value of the operand.

The guidelines for using logical operators are also mentioned in PEP 8. Some key guidelines include:

- Don't compare boolean values to `True` or `False` using logical operators. Instead, use the boolean values directly in the condition.
- Use parentheses to group logical operations if necessary, to enhance readability. For example, `result = (a and b) or (c and d)` instead of `result = a and b or c and d`.

Following these guidelines ensures that your code is consistent, readable, and easier to understand by other developers.
