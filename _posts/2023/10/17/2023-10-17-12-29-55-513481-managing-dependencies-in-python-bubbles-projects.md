When working on Python projects, managing dependencies is a crucial aspect to ensure smooth development and deployment. Bubbles, being a Python-based framework for building web applications, also requires an effective approach to handle dependencies.

## Dependency Management in Bubbles

Bubbles leverages the `pip` package manager, which is the standard for Python dependency management, to handle project dependencies. To begin managing dependencies in a Bubbles project, you need to create a `requirements.txt` file in the project's root directory.

### Creating a `requirements.txt` file

To create a `requirements.txt` file, follow these steps:

1. Open your project's root directory.
2. Create a new file and name it `requirements.txt`.
3. Open the `requirements.txt` file in a text editor.

### Specifying Dependencies

In the `requirements.txt` file, you can specify the dependencies for your Bubbles project. Each dependency should be listed on a separate line, following the format `package-name==version`.

Here's an example `requirements.txt` file:

```text
bubbles==1.0.0
flask==2.0.1
requests==2.26.0
```

In this example, we specify the versions for the `bubbles`, `flask`, and `requests` packages.

### Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies for your Bubbles project, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal or command prompt, and run the following command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the specified packages along with their respective versions.

### Updating Dependencies

To update the dependencies in your Bubbles project, you can modify the `requirements.txt` file by changing the specified versions and running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command again.

## Conclusion

Managing dependencies in Python Bubbles projects is straightforward thanks to `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file. By specifying the required packages and their versions, you can easily install, update, and control the dependencies of your Bubbles project.
