To get started with Python Bubbles, you need to install the library using pip:

```python
pip install python-bubbles
```

Once installed, you can import the library and create a bubble chart with just a few lines of code:

```python
from python_bubbles import BubbleChart

# Create a new bubble chart
chart = BubbleChart()

# Add data points to the chart
chart.add_data_point('Category 1', 10, 20, 30)
chart.add_data_point('Category 2', 15, 25, 35)

# Customize the chart
chart.title = 'Bubble Chart Example'
chart.x_axis_label = 'X-axis'
chart.y_axis_label = 'Y-axis'
chart.color_palette = ['blue', 'green']

# Render the chart
chart.render()
```

In the code snippet above, we first import the `BubbleChart` class from the `python_bubbles` module. We then create a new instance of the `BubbleChart` class and add data points to it. Each data point consists of a category name, along with the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and size of the bubble.

After adding the data points, we can customize the chart by setting properties such as the title, x-axis label, y-axis label, and color palette. Finally, we call the `render()` method to display the chart.

Python Bubbles offers various customization options such as changing the size and color of bubbles, adding legends, and adjusting the axis limits. Be sure to check out the official documentation for more information on how to make the most out of Python Bubbles.
