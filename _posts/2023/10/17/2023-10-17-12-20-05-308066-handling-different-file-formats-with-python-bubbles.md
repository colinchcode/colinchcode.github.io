## Introduction

Often, when working with data, we encounter different file formats. Each file format has its own structure and requirements for reading and writing data. Python Bubbles simplifies this process by providing a unified interface to handle these different file formats effortlessly.

## Installing Python Bubbles

Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can install Python Bubbles using pip:

```bash
pip install python-bubbles
```

## Working with CSV Files

CSV files are commonly used for storing tabular data. Python Bubbles makes it straightforward to read and write CSV files. Let's see how to read a CSV file:

```python
import bubbles

data = bubbles.read_csv('data.csv')
print(data)
```

To write to a CSV file, you can use the `to_csv` method:

```python
import bubbles

data = [
    {'name': 'John', 'age': 25},
    {'name': 'Amy', 'age': 30},
    {'name': 'Michael', 'age': 35}
]

bubbles.to_csv('data.csv', data)
```

## Working with JSON Files

JSON files are commonly used to store structured data. With Python Bubbles, working with JSON files becomes effortless. Here's how to read a JSON file:

```python
import bubbles

data = bubbles.read_json('data.json')
print(data)
```

To write to a JSON file, you can use the `to_json` method:

```python
import bubbles

data = [
    {'name': 'John', 'age': 25},
    {'name': 'Amy', 'age': 30},
    {'name': 'Michael', 'age': 35}
]

bubbles.to_json('data.json', data)
```

## Working with Excel Files

Working with Excel files can be challenging due to their complex structure. Python Bubbles simplifies Excel file operations. Here's an example of reading an Excel file:

```python
import bubbles

data = bubbles.read_excel('data.xlsx', sheet_name='Sheet1')
print(data)
```

To write to an Excel file, you can use the `to_excel` method:

```python
import bubbles

data = [
    {'name': 'John', 'age': 25},
    {'name': 'Amy', 'age': 30},
    {'name': 'Michael', 'age': 35}
]

bubbles.to_excel('data.xlsx', data, sheet_name='Sheet1')
```

## Conclusion

Python Bubbles provides a convenient way to handle different file formats in Python. In this tutorial, we learned how to use Python Bubbles to read and write CSV, JSON, and Excel files. Harness the power of Python Bubbles to simplify your data handling tasks and save time.
