When writing Python code, it is important to adhere to the guidelines defined in [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). One particular aspect of PEP 8 that often goes unnoticed is the recommendations for handling trailing whitespace and blank lines.

## Trailing Whitespace

Trailing whitespace refers to any extra spaces or tabs that appear at the end of a line. While these may seem harmless, they can cause issues when collaborating with other developers or when running code through certain tools.

PEP 8 recommends **removing trailing whitespace** from all lines. This ensures consistent formatting and makes the code easier to read and maintain. Most modern code editors have built-in functionality to automatically remove trailing whitespace, so it's a good practice to configure your editor to do so.

## Blank Lines

Blank lines, on the other hand, refer to empty lines within the code. PEP 8 provides some guidelines regarding the usage of blank lines:

1. **Surround top-level function and class definitions with two blank lines.** This helps separate different sections of code and enhances readability.

   ```
   def func1():
       pass


   def func2():
       pass
   ```

2. **Use a single blank line to separate logical sections within a function.** This improves code organization and makes it easier to understand the flow of the program.

   ```
   def my_function():
       setup()
       
       perform_task1()
       
       do_something()
       
       perform_task2()
   ```

3. **Avoid excessive blank lines.** Too many blank lines can make the code look cluttered and affect readability. Use them sparingly and only when necessary to improve code structure.

## Trim Trailing Whitespace with Flake8

To automate the process of removing trailing whitespace, you can utilize code analysis tools like [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/). Flake8 not only detects PEP 8 violations but can also automatically fix some of them.

To install Flake8, use the following command:

```shell
pip install flake8
```

Once installed, you can run Flake8 from the command line to check your code for trailing whitespace and many other PEP 8 violations:

```shell
flake8 myscript.py
```

To automatically **fix trailing whitespace**, use the `--max-line-length` option along with the `--in-place` option:

```shell
flake8 --max-line-length 120 --in-place myscript.py
```

This will modify the file `myscript.py` in-place and remove any trailing whitespace.

By following PEP 8 guidelines and the recommendations for handling trailing whitespace and blank lines, you can improve code readability and maintainability, making your Python code more professional and consistent.
