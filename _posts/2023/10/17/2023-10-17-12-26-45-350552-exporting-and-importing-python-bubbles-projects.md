## Exporting a Python Bubbles Project

To export a Python Bubbles project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Python Bubbles project you want to export.
2. Make sure all the necessary dependencies and libraries are installed.
3. Save your project by clicking on the "Save" button or using the keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+S).
4. Create a new folder on your computer and give it a meaningful name.
5. Copy all the Python script files (.py) and any other project-specific files into the folder you created.

It is important to copy all the necessary files, including any custom images or datasets that your project relies on. This ensures that when you import the project on a different machine, all the required resources are available.

## Importing a Python Bubbles Project

To import a Python Bubbles project on a different machine, follow these steps:

1. Copy the folder containing the project files to the new machine.
2. Open your chosen Python IDE or code editor.
3. Navigate to the location of the project folder using the file explorer.
4. Open the main Python script file (.py) of the project.
5. Make sure all the required dependencies and libraries are installed.
6. Run the Python script to launch the project.

Once you have successfully imported the project, you can start exploring and interacting with it just like you did on the original machine.

## Conclusion

Exporting and importing Python Bubbles projects allows for easy sharing and transferring of your interactive data visualizations. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can ensure that your projects retain all the necessary files and dependencies when moved to a different machine.
