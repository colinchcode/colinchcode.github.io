When writing Python code, following the guidelines set out in PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) is considered best practice. PEP 8 provides a set of style guidelines for writing Python code that aims to improve code readability and consistency.

One important aspect of code readability is the use of blank lines and whitespace within functions and classes. Proper use of blank lines and whitespace can help make your code more readable and easy to understand.

## Use of Blank Lines within Functions and Classes

According to PEP 8, you should use blank lines to separate different parts of your code within functions and classes. These include:

1. Separating function and method definitions: It is recommended to use two blank lines between function and method definitions to make it clear where one function ends and another begins. This enhances code organization and readability.

```python
def function1():
    # code for function1

def function2():
    # code for function2
```

2. Separating logical sections within a function or method: If a function or method contains multiple logical sections, you can use a single blank line to separate them. This improves the readability and comprehension of the code.

```python
def function():
    # code for first logical section

    # code for second logical section

    # code for third logical section
```

3. Separating classes and class-level methods: When defining multiple classes or class-level methods within a module, it is recommended to separate them with two blank lines. This improves the clarity and organization of your code.

```python
class MyClass1:
    # code for MyClass1

class MyClass2:
    # code for MyClass2
```

## Use of Whitespace within Functions and Classes

PEP 8 also provides guidelines for using whitespace within functions and classes. These include:

1. Indentation: Use 4 spaces for indentation to improve readability and maintain consistency throughout your code. Avoid using tabs or a different number of spaces for indentation.

```python
def my_function():
    if some_condition:
        do_something()
        do_something_else()
```

2. Line Length: PEP 8 recommends limiting each line of code to a maximum of 79 characters for better readability. If a line of code exceeds this limit, it is preferred to use parentheses for line continuation.

3. Operator Spacing: Use a single space around operators (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `==`) to enhance readability and make your code more visually appealing.

4. Function and Method Definitions: Use a single space after commas in function and method definitions to improve readability.

```python
def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    # code for my_function
```

For more detailed guidelines regarding the use of whitespace and blank lines within functions and classes, please refer to [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id18).

Following these guidelines not only makes your code more readable but also improves collaboration with other developers by adhering to a common coding style. By maintaining consistent usage of blank lines and whitespace, you can enhance the overall quality and maintainability of your Python code.
