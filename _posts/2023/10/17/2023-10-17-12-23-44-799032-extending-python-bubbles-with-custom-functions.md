Python Bubbles is a popular open-source library that provides various tools and utilities for working with data in Python. While it offers a wide range of functionalities, there may be cases where you want to extend it with your own custom functions to better suit your specific needs.

In this article, we will explore how you can extend Python Bubbles by adding your own custom functions.

## Step 1: Install Python Bubbles

First, you need to install Python Bubbles. You can do this using pip by running the following command:

```bash
pip install python-bubbles
```

## Step 2: Create a custom function

To add your own custom function to Python Bubbles, you need to create a new Python module and define your function in it. Let's say we want to create a custom function called `calculate_average` that calculates the average of a list of numbers.

Create a new file called `custom_functions.py` and add the following code:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)
    return average
```

## Step 3: Register the custom function

Once your custom function is defined, you need to register it with Python Bubbles so that it becomes available for use. To do this, you need to create a new instance of the `Bubbles` class and register your function using the `register` method.

Open your Python script file and add the following code:

```python
from bubbles import Bubbles
from custom_functions import calculate_average

b = Bubbles()
b.register(calculate_average)
```

## Step 4: Use the custom function

Now that your custom function is registered with Python Bubbles, you can use it in your data processing tasks. For example, let's say you want to calculate the average of a column in a CSV file.

```python
data = b.read_csv("data.csv")
average = b.calculate_average(data["column_name"])
print(average)
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can easily extend Python Bubbles with your own custom functions. This allows you to tailor the library to your specific needs and enhance your data processing capabilities.

Python Bubbles provides a powerful framework for working with data in Python, and adding your own custom functions gives you even more flexibility and control over your data processing workflows.

Please refer to the official Python Bubbles documentation for more information and examples on how to use the library.
