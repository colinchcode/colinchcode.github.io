The Python Bubbles library is a powerful tool for creating interactive and animated visualizations. With its user-friendly interface, it allows developers to quickly create engaging visualizations. However, there may be times when you want to customize the workflow to better suit your needs or add additional functionalities. In this blog post, we will explore how you can customize the Python Bubbles workflow.

## Getting Started with Python Bubbles
<a name="getting-started"></a>

To get started with Python Bubbles, you first need to install the library by running the following command:

```shell
pip install python-bubbles
```

Once the library is installed, you can import it into your Python script and start creating visualizations. Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
import bubbles

# Create a new bubble canvas
canvas = bubbles.Canvas(width=500, height=500)

# Add a circle shape to the canvas
circle = bubbles.Circle(radius=50, x=250, y=250, color="blue")
canvas.add(circle)

# Render the canvas and display the visualization
canvas.render()
```

This code creates a canvas with a blue circle in the center. You can customize various parameters such as the size, position, and color of the circle.

## Customizing the Visual Style
<a name="customizing-visual-style"></a>

Python Bubbles allows you to customize the visual style of your visualizations. You can change the color, size, and other properties of shapes and add various effects such as gradients and shadows. Here's an example of how to customize the visual style of a circle:

```python
import bubbles

canvas = bubbles.Canvas(width=500, height=500)

circle = bubbles.Circle(radius=50, x=250, y=250, color="blue")
circle.set_border_color("black")
circle.set_border_width(2)
circle.set_shadow("gray")
canvas.add(circle)

canvas.render()
```

In this example, we added a black border, increased the border width, and added a gray shadow to the circle.

## Adding Interactivity
<a name="adding-interactivity"></a>

Python Bubbles also allows you to add interactivity to your visualizations. You can respond to user actions such as mouse clicks and keyboard events, and update the visualization accordingly. Here's an example of how to add interactivity to a circle:

```python
import bubbles

canvas = bubbles.Canvas(width=500, height=500)

circle = bubbles.Circle(radius=50, x=250, y=250, color="blue")

# Define a custom function that changes the color of the circle when clicked
def change_color():
    if circle.get_color() == "blue":
        circle.set_color("red")
    else:
        circle.set_color("blue")
    canvas.render()

# Attach the custom function to the circle's click event
circle.on_click(change_color)

canvas.add(circle)
canvas.render()
```

In this example, the color of the circle changes from blue to red and vice versa when it is clicked. You can add various interactive behaviors to different shapes and elements of your visualization.

## Extending Functionality
<a name="extending-functionality"></a>

If the built-in functionalities of Python Bubbles are not sufficient for your needs, you can extend its functionality by creating custom shapes or animations. You can subclass the existing shape classes or create entirely new classes. Here's an example of how to create a custom shape:

```python
import bubbles

class CustomShape(bubbles.Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height, color):
        super().__init__(color=color)
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
    
    def render(self, context):
        context.fill_rectangle(self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height)

canvas = bubbles.Canvas(width=500, height=500)

custom_shape = CustomShape(width=100, height=200, color="green")
canvas.add(custom_shape)

canvas.render()
```

In this example, we created a custom shape called `CustomShape` that renders as a rectangle with a specific width, height, and color. You can create any custom shape or animation you want by subclassing the appropriate classes provided by Python Bubbles.

## Conclusion
