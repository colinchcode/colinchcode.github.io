In Python, importing modules or packages from built-in libraries is a common practice to extend the functionality of your code. However, the way you import these modules can impact the readability and maintainability of your code. The [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide provides recommendations on how to import from built-in libraries in a consistent and stylistic manner.

## 1. Importing Multiple Modules

If you need to import multiple modules from the same built-in library, you have two options:

### Option 1: Import Everything

```python
import module1
import module2
```

### Option 2: Import Separate Lines

```python
import module1, module2
```

*Note:* While the second option can save a few lines of code, it is generally recommended to use the first option to enhance clarity and avoid any potential confusion.

## 2. Importing Specific Members

If you only need to use specific members from a module, it is usually better to import only those members instead of importing the entire module. This improves both the performance of your code and makes it clear which members are being used.

```python
from module import member1, member2
```

## 3. Avoid Wildcard Imports

Wildcard imports, which import all members of a module, are generally discouraged. They can introduce naming conflicts and make it harder to track the source of a particular function or variable.

```python
from module import *
```

## 4. Importing Multiple Modules with Aliases

In some cases, you may need to import multiple modules from the same built-in library, but the module names  conflict with each other. In such situations, it is advisable to use aliases to differentiate the module names.

```python
import module1 as m1
import module2 as m2
```

## 5. Importing Modules from Packages

When importing modules from packages in the built-in library, you should follow the package.module pattern to maintain consistency.

```python
import package.module
```

## Conclusion

By adhering to the stylistic considerations outlined in PEP 8, you can improve the readability, maintainability, and overall quality of your code when importing modules from built-in libraries. It is important to follow these conventions to ensure your code is consistent and easily understood by other developers.
