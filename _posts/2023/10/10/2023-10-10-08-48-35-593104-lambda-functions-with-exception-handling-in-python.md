Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are a powerful feature in Python that allows us to create small, one-line functions without using the `def` keyword. These functions can take any number of arguments and return a single value. 

In addition to their simplicity and conciseness, lambda functions can also be combined with exception handling to handle errors gracefully. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where we want to perform some operations on a given input and handle any potential exceptions that may arise.

Let's take a look at an example of using a lambda function with exception handling in Python:

```python
divide = lambda x, y: x / y if y != 0 else None

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero")
```

In the above example, we define a lambda function called `divide` that takes two arguments `x` and `y`. It divides `x` by `y` if `y` is not equal to zero, otherwise it returns `None`. 

We then use a try-except block to handle the `ZeroDivisionError` that may occur when dividing by zero. If an exception is raised, we catch it and print an error message.

Running the above code will output:

```
Error: Division by zero
```

By using a lambda function with exception handling, we can gracefully handle the case where division by zero occurs without the program crashing.

Lambda functions are commonly used in scenarios where a small function is needed and it won't be reused in other parts of the code. They are especially useful when working with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

In addition to exception handling, lambda functions can also be used in other areas of Python programming such as sorting, event handling, and functional programming paradigms.

It's important to note that while lambda functions can be powerful and convenient, they should be used judiciously. They are not meant to replace regular functions and may not be suitable for complex or multi-step operations.

In conclusion, lambda functions with exception handling provide a compact and elegant way to handle errors in Python code. They can make our code more concise and readable, especially in scenarios where only simple operations are performed. However, it is important to use them judiciously and consider the trade-offs before applying them in more complex scenarios.
