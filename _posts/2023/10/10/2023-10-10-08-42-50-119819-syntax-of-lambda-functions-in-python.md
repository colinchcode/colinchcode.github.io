Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are short and concise functions that do not have a name. They are commonly used when you need a simple one-liner function without defining a traditional function using the `def` keyword.

The syntax of a lambda function in Python is as follows:

```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

Let's break down the different parts of the lambda function syntax:

- `lambda`: The keyword used to define a lambda function.
- `arguments`: The input parameters or arguments that the lambda function takes. These arguments are separated by commas if there are multiple arguments.
- `:`: The separator used to separate the arguments from the expression.
- `expression`: The result or output of the lambda function.

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the syntax:

```python
# Example 1: Lambda function with a single argument
square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(5))  # Output: 25

# Example 2: Lambda function with multiple arguments
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

In the first example, the lambda function `square` takes a single argument `x` and returns the square of `x`. The lambda function is assigned to the variable `square`, and we can call it like a normal function to compute the square of a number.

In the second example, the lambda function `add` takes two arguments `x` and `y`, and returns the sum of `x` and `y`. We can call this lambda function just like any other function and provide the required arguments.

Lambda functions are often used in combination with built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`. They provide a convenient way to write concise and functional-style code.

Keep in mind that lambda functions are intended for simple and short expressions. For more complex logic, it is recommended to use traditional functions defined using the `def` keyword.

That's the basic syntax of lambda functions in Python. They offer a compact and efficient way to create small functions without defining them separately.
