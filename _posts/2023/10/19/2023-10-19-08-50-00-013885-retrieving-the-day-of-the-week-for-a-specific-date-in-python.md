### Introduction

Python provides the `datetime` module which allows us to work with dates and times effectively. With the help of this module, we can easily find the day of the week for a given date.

### Retrieving the Day of the Week

To retrieve the day of the week for a specific date, we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the `datetime` module.
2. Create a `datetime` object with the desired date.
3. Use the `strftime` method to format the date and retrieve the day of the week.

The `strftime` method is used to format a given date and time according to a specified format. In our case, we will use the `%A` directive to retrieve the full weekday name.

### Example

Let's see an example of how to retrieve the day of the week for a specific date:

```python
import datetime

date_string = "2022-05-30"
date_object = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_string, "%Y-%m-%d")

day_of_week = date_object.strftime("%A")
print(f"The day of the week for {date_string} is {day_of_week}.")
```

In the above example, we import the `datetime` module and specify the desired date as a string. We then convert the string into a `datetime` object using the `strptime` method. Finally, we retrieve the day of the week using the `strftime` method with the `%A` directive.

The output will be:

```
The day of the week for 2022-05-30 is Monday.
```

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to retrieve the day of the week for a specific date in Python. By using the `datetime` module, we were able to easily convert a date string into a `datetime` object and retrieve the day of the week using the `strftime` method.
