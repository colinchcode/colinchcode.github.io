## Introduction to Goose

"Goose" is a Python library specifically built for extracting information, such as article text, images, and metadata, from web pages. It has proven to be effective in web scraping tasks related to content recommendation systems.

Some key features of Goose include:

- Automatic extraction of article text: It aims to extract the main content of an article by removing boilerplate text, ads, and menus.
- Metadata extraction: It extracts useful information such as title, published date, author, and keywords.
- Language detection: It can identify the language of an article, which is useful for handling multilingual content.

## Installation

To install Goose, you can use pip, the package installer for Python:

```python
pip install goose3
```

Note that "goose3" is the Python 3 compatible version of Goose.

## Basic Usage

Once you have installed Goose, you can start using it to extract article information. Here's a basic usage example:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

# Create a Goose object
g = Goose()

# Fetch an article URL and extract its main content
article = g.extract(url='https://example.com/article')

# Access extracted information
print(article.title)
print(article.publish_date)
print(article.authors)
print(article.cleaned_text)
```

In the above example, we create a `Goose` object and use the `extract` method to fetch and extract information from the provided article URL. We can then access various attributes of the `Article` object, such as `title`, `publish_date`, `authors`, and `cleaned_text`.

## Advanced Usage

Goose provides additional functionalities for fine-tuning the extraction process. Here are some examples:

- Specify a custom configuration:

  ```python
  g = Goose({'use_meta_language': False, 'target_language': 'en'})
  ```

- Extract only the article text without any additional information:

  ```python
  g.extract(url='https://example.com/article', 
            include_all_content=False)
  ```

- Set a timeout for fetching an article:

  ```python
  article = g.extract(url='https://example.com/article', 
                      http_timeout=5)
  ```

- Extract article text from a raw HTML string:

  ```python
  html = "<html><body><h1>Article Title</h1><p>Article text...</p></body></html>"
  article = g.extract(raw_html=html)
  ```
