In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. A variable is like a container that holds a specific value which can be referenced throughout the program.

## Declaring Variables

To declare a variable in Python, you simply assign a value to it using the equals sign (=). The general syntax is as follows:

```python
variable_name = value
```

Here's an example:

```python
name = "John"
age = 25
salary = 1500.50
```

In this example, three variables are declared: `name` which stores a string value "John", `age` which stores an integer value 25, and `salary` which stores a floating-point value 1500.50.

## Variable Naming Rules

When naming variables in Python, there are a few rules to follow:

- The first character of a variable name must be a letter or an underscore (_).
- The remaining characters can be letters, numbers, or underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive, so `name` and `Name` are considered as two different variables.
- Avoid using reserved keywords as variable names, such as `if`, `else`, `while`, and so on.

Here are some valid variable names:

```python
age = 30
_name = "Alice"
monthly_salary = 2000.00
```

And here are some invalid variable names:

```python
3years = 36          # Variable name cannot start with a number
my-name = "John"     # Variable name cannot contain hyphens
if = 10              # Reserved keyword cannot be used as a variable name
```

## Assigning New Values to Variables

In Python, you can assign new values to variables as many times as needed. The new value can be of a different data type. For example:

```python
name = "John"
name = "Jane"

age = 30
age = 35
```

In these examples, the `name` variable is first assigned the value "John" and then reassigned the value "Jane". Similarly, the `age` variable is assigned the value 30 and then reassigned the value 35.

## Conclusion

Variables are an essential concept in every programming language, including Python. They allow us to store and manipulate data. By following the naming rules and understanding how to assign values to variables, you can effectively use variables in Python to build more complex programs.
