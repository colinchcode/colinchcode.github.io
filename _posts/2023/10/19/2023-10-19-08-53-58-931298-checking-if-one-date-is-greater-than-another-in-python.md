To compare dates in Python, we can use the `datetime` module. This module provides a `date` class that allows us to work with dates easily.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to compare two dates:

```python
from datetime import date

# Create two date objects
date1 = date(2022, 1, 1)
date2 = date(2022, 1, 10)

# Compare the dates
if date1 > date2:
    print("date1 is greater than date2")
elif date1 < date2:
    print("date1 is less than date2")
else:
    print("date1 is equal to date2")
```

In this example, we create two `date` objects, `date1` and `date2`, representing January 1, 2022, and January 10, 2022, respectively. 

We then use the comparison operators (`>`, `<`, and `==`) to compare the two dates. If `date1` is greater than `date2`, we print "date1 is greater than date2". If `date1` is less than `date2`, we print "date1 is less than date2". And if `date1` is equal to `date2`, we print "date1 is equal to date2".

You can customize the dates in the code snippet to compare any specific dates you need. The `datetime` module also provides various methods to perform arithmetic operations on dates.

Now you know how to compare two dates in Python. Make sure to use the `datetime` module to effortlessly work with dates in your projects.
