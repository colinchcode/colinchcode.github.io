When working with CSV (Comma Separated Values) files, it is often necessary to extract specific content or information from them. Python Goose is a powerful Python library that can help with content extraction from CSV files. In this blog post, we will explore how to use Python Goose to extract content from CSV files.

## Installation

To get started with Python Goose, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can install Python Goose using pip, the Python package installer. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
pip install python-goose
```

## Reading CSV Files

Before we can extract content from a CSV file, we need to read the file and load its contents into memory. Python provides a built-in `csv` module that makes it easy to work with CSV files.

Here's an example of how to read a CSV file using the `csv` module:

```python
import csv

def read_csv_file(file_path):
    content = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        reader = csv.reader(file)
        for row in reader:
            content.append(row)
    return content

file_path = 'data.csv'
csv_content = read_csv_file(file_path)
```

In the above code, we define a `read_csv_file` function that takes the file path as an argument and returns the contents of the CSV file as a list of rows.

## Extracting Content

Once we have read the CSV file and loaded its contents into memory, we can use Python Goose to extract specific content from it. Python Goose provides a simple and intuitive API for content extraction.

Here's an example of how to use Python Goose to extract content from a CSV file:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

def extract_content(csv_content):
    extracted_content = []
    g = Goose()
    for row in csv_content:
        url = row[0]
        article = g.extract(url=url)
        extracted_content.append((url, article.title, article.cleaned_text))
    return extracted_content

extracted_content = extract_content(csv_content)
```

In the above code, we define an `extract_content` function that takes the CSV content as an argument. We create an instance of the `Goose` class, which is the main class provided by Python Goose for content extraction. We iterate over each row in the CSV content, extract the URL from the row, and use the `extract` method of the `Goose` class to extract the article's title and cleaned text from the URL. We append the extracted content to a new list and return it.

## Conclusion

Python Goose is a valuable tool for content extraction from CSV files. By combining the `csv` module with Python Goose, we can easily read and extract content from CSV files in Python. This can be useful in scenarios where we need to analyze or process specific data from large CSV files.

In this blog post, we covered the basics of using Python Goose for content extraction from CSV files. You can find more information about Python Goose in the [official documentation](https://github.com/nitanmarcel/python-goose).
