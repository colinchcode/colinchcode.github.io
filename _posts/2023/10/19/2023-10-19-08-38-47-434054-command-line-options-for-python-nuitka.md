Python Nuitka is a powerful compiler that translates your Python code into highly efficient C code. It offers a wide range of command line options to customize the compilation process and optimize the generated binary. In this article, we will explore some useful command line options for Python Nuitka.

## 1. --standalone

When using the `--standalone` option, Python Nuitka includes all necessary runtime files in the generated binary. This allows you to distribute the binary as a single file, making it easier to deploy and run your Python application on different machines without worrying about missing dependencies.

```bash
$ nuitka --standalone myscript.py
```

## 2. --recurse-directory

The `--recurse-directory` option tells Python Nuitka to recursively include all Python files in a given directory during the compilation process. This is especially useful when your project is spread across multiple files and directories.

```bash
$ nuitka --recurse-directory /path/to/project myscript.py
```

## 3. --recurse-all

The `--recurse-all` option forces Python Nuitka to include all imported modules and packages, even if they are not used directly in your code. This can be helpful when dealing with dynamic imports or when you want to make sure all dependencies are captured in the compiled binary.

```bash
$ nuitka --recurse-all myscript.py
```

## 4. --plugin-enable=plugin_name

Python Nuitka supports plugins that provide additional optimizations or features. The `--plugin-enable` option allows you to enable specific plugins during the compilation process. Replace `plugin_name` with the actual name of the plugin you want to enable.

```bash
$ nuitka --plugin-enable=plugin_name myscript.py
```

## 5. --strip

By using the `--strip` option, Python Nuitka removes unnecessary debugging symbols from the generated binary, resulting in a smaller file size. This can be especially useful if you want to reduce the size of your application or if you don't need to debug the compiled code.

```bash
$ nuitka --strip myscript.py
```

These are just a few examples of the command line options available for Python Nuitka. The tool provides many more options to fine-tune the compilation process and optimize the generated code. To learn more, please refer to the [Python Nuitka documentation](https://nuitka.net/doc/user-manual.html).

Happy compiling!
