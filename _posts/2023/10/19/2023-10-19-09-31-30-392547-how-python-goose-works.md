Python Goose is a web scraping library written in Python that allows you to extract and parse content from web pages. It is specifically designed for extracting article text and metadata from news websites.

## Installation

You can install Python Goose using `pip`:

```shell
pip install python-goose3
```

## Extracting Article Content

To extract the content from a web page using Python Goose, you first need to create an instance of the `Goose` class. Then, you can use the `extract` method to extract the article content from a given URL.

```python
from goose3 import Goose

url = 'https://www.example.com/article'

g = Goose()
article = g.extract(url)

print(article.title)
print(article.cleaned_text)
```

In the above code, we create a `Goose` instance, pass in the URL of the article we want to extract, and then call the `extract` method to get the article content. The `article` object contains various properties such as `title` and `cleaned_text` which we can access to get the extracted information.

## Extracting Article Metadata

Python Goose also provides methods to extract metadata from the article, such as the publish date, author, and domain. To access the metadata, you can use the `publish_date`, `authors`, and `domain` properties of the `article` object.

```python
print(article.publish_date)
print(article.authors)
print(article.domain)
```

## Configuring Python Goose

Python Goose provides various configuration options that you can use to customize its behavior. You can set these options by passing a `Configuration` object when creating the `Goose` instance.

```python
from goose3.configuration import Configuration

config = Configuration()
config.enable_image_fetching = False

g = Goose(config=config)
```

In the above code, we create a `Configuration` object and set the `enable_image_fetching` option to `False`. This disables image fetching during the content extraction process.

## Conclusion

Python Goose is a powerful web scraping library that makes it easy to extract and parse article content from web pages. It provides a simple API to extract text and metadata from news articles. With its configuration options, you can customize its behavior according to your requirements.
