In Python, you can easily check if a given date falls on a weekend using the `datetime` module. The `datetime` module provides classes for manipulating dates and times.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to check if a given date falls on a weekend:

```python
import datetime

def is_weekend(date):
    # Get the weekday index, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6
    weekday = date.weekday()
    
    # Check if the weekday is Saturday (5) or Sunday (6)
    return weekday == 5 or weekday == 6

# Create a sample date
date = datetime.date(2023, 10, 14)  # Saturday

# Check if the date falls on a weekend
if is_weekend(date):
    print("The date falls on a weekend!")
else:
    print("The date does not fall on a weekend.")
```

In this example, we define a function called `is_weekend` that takes a `date` object as input. It uses the `weekday()` method of the `date` object to get the weekday index, where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6. Then, it checks if the weekday is either Saturday (5) or Sunday (6) and returns `True` if it is, indicating the date falls on a weekend.

We create a sample date object `date` with a specific date (in this case, October 14, 2023, which is a Saturday) and then call the `is_weekend` function to check if the date falls on a weekend. Finally, we print the appropriate message based on the result.

You can modify the `date` object with any desired date to check if it falls on a weekend.

By using this code snippet, you can easily determine whether a given date falls on a weekend in Python.
