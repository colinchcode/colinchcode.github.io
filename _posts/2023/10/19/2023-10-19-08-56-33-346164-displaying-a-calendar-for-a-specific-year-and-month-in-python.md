## Introduction
Python's `calendar` module provides various functions to work with calendars, including creating calendars, formatting dates, and performing date calculations.

To display a calendar for a specific year and month, we can make use of the `calendar.month()` function. This function takes in the year and month as arguments and returns a string representing the calendar for that specific year and month.

## Displaying a Calendar
To display a calendar, we need to import the `calendar` module using the following line of code:

```python
import calendar
```

Next, we can call the `calendar.month()` function with the desired year and month as arguments. The function returns a string representing the calendar for the specified year and month.

```python
calendar.month(year, month)
```

## Example
Let's display a calendar for the month of November 2022:

```python
import calendar

year = 2022
month = 11

cal = calendar.month(year, month)
print(cal)
```

Output:
```
   November 2022
Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
   1  2  3  4  5  6
 7  8  9 10 11 12 13
14 15 16 17 18 19 20
21 22 23 24 25 26 27
28 29 30
```

The printed output shows the calendar for November 2022 with the days of the week and dates.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to display a calendar for a specific year and month in Python. By utilizing the `calendar` module, it becomes easy to generate calendars for different time periods. Experiment with different year and month combinations to explore more functionality offered by the `calendar` module.
