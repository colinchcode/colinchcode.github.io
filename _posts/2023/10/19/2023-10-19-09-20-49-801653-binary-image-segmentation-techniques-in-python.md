## 1. Thresholding

Thresholding is a simple technique where we convert a grayscale image into a binary image by selecting a threshold value. Pixels with intensity values below the threshold are set to 0 (black) and those above the threshold are set to 255 (white).

```python
import cv2

image = cv2.imread('image.png', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
threshold_value = 127
_, thresholded_image = cv2.threshold(image, threshold_value, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
```
The `cv2.threshold` function is used to perform thresholding. It takes the grayscale image, threshold value, maximum value (255), and the type of thresholding (in this case, `cv2.THRESH_BINARY`) as input.

## 2. Otsu's Method

Otsu's method is an adaptive thresholding technique that automatically calculates the threshold value based on the image histogram. It assumes that the image contains two classes of pixels, foreground and background, and aims to minimize the intra-class variance.

```python
_, otsu_thresholded_image = cv2.threshold(image, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY + cv2.THRESH_OTSU)
```

Here, we set the threshold value to 0 as Otsu's method will automatically compute the optimal threshold value using the image histogram. The `cv2.THRESH_OTSU` flag is used to indicate Otsu's method.

## 3. Adaptive Thresholding

Adaptive thresholding is a technique where the threshold value is computed for every pixel based on a small neighborhood around it. This is particularly useful when the image has uneven lighting conditions.

```python
adaptive_thresholded_image = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(image, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
```

Here, we use the `cv2.adaptiveThreshold` function and set the maximum value to 255. We also specify the adaptive thresholding method (`cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C`), the type of thresholding (`cv2.THRESH_BINARY`), the block size (11), and the constant subtracted from the mean to compute the threshold value (2).

<a name="connected-component-labeling"></a>
## 4. Connected Component Labeling

Connected Component Labeling (CCL) is a technique used to identify and label connected regions in a binary image. Each connected region is assigned a unique label for further analysis.

```python
_, labeled_image = cv2.connectedComponents(thresholded_image)
```

The `cv2.connectedComponents` function is used to perform connected component labeling. It takes the binary image as input and returns the labeled image, where each connected component is assigned a unique label.

## 5. Conclusion

Binary image segmentation is a crucial step in many computer vision applications. In this article, we explored some popular techniques, including thresholding, Otsu's method, adaptive thresholding, and connected component labeling. These techniques offer different advantages and can be used based on the specific requirements of the application.
