In Python, you can easily retrieve the current year using the `datetime` module. The `datetime` module provides classes for working with dates and times.

To find the current year, you need to import the `datetime` module and then call the `datetime.now()` method to get the current date and time. Once you have the current date and time, you can use the `year` attribute to extract just the year component.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to find the current year in Python:

```python
import datetime

current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
```

In the code snippet above, we first import the `datetime` module. Then, we call the `now()` method of the `datetime` class to get the current date and time as a `datetime` object. Finally, we use the `year` attribute to retrieve the year component of the `datetime` object and assign it to the `current_year` variable.

You can now use the `current_year` variable in your program to perform any operation that requires the current year.

It's worth noting that the current year will be based on the system's local time. If you need to work with date and time in a specific timezone, you can use the `pytz` library in conjunction with the `datetime` module.
