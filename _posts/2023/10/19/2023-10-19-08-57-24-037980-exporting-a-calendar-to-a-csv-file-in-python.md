## Introduction
CSV is a common file format for storing tabular data. It is widely supported by various applications and can be easily imported into spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets.

Python provides the `csv` module that allows us to work with CSV files. We will use this module to export a calendar to a CSV file.

## Installing Dependencies
To get started, we need to install the `csv` module which is available in the standard library. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```python
pip install csv
```

## Exporting Calendar to CSV
Now let's write the code to export a calendar to a CSV file. We will use the `csv.writer` class to write data to the CSV file.

```python
import csv
import calendar

def export_calendar_to_csv(year, filename):
    # Get calendar data
    cal = calendar.calendar(year)

    # Create a CSV file
    with open(filename, 'w', newline='') as file:
        writer = csv.writer(file)

        # Write the calendar data to CSV
        writer.writerow(['Month', 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'])
        
        for line in cal.split('\n'):
            writer.writerow(line.split())

    print(f"Calendar exported to {filename}")

# Usage example
export_calendar_to_csv(2022, 'calendar.csv')
```

In the example above, we define the `export_calendar_to_csv` function that takes a year and a filename as parameters. Inside the function, we use the `calendar.calendar` method to generate the calendar data for the specified year. Then, we create a new CSV file using the `open` function and the `'w'` mode. The `csv.writer` is used to write the calendar data to the CSV file row by row.

Finally, we call the `export_calendar_to_csv` function with the year and filename to export the calendar.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to export a calendar to a CSV file using Python. We used the `csv` module to write the calendar data to a CSV file and demonstrated an example usage.

CSV files are a versatile way to store and share tabular data. You can further explore the `csv` module to customize the export process and include additional data in the CSV file.
