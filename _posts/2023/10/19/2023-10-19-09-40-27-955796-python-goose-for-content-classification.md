When it comes to classifying different types of content, Python provides us with an excellent library called Goose. Goose is a web extraction tool that allows us to extract the main text and metadata from various web pages. It is especially useful for tasks like content classification, where we need to analyze the textual content of web pages.

To get started with Python Goose, we first need to install it. We can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install goose3
```

Once Goose is installed, we can import it in our Python script and use it to extract the main text and metadata from a web page. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use Goose for content classification:

```python
from goose3 import Goose

# Create an instance of Goose
g = Goose()

# Extract content from a web page
url = 'https://www.example.com'
article = g.extract(url)

# Get the main text of the web page
text = article.cleaned_text

# Print the extracted text
print(text)
```

In the code above, we first import the Goose library and create an instance of it. Then, we use the `extract()` method to extract the content from a given web page. We pass the URL of the web page as a parameter to the `extract()` method. After that, we can access the main text of the web page using the `cleaned_text` attribute of the `article` object. Finally, we print the extracted text.

Goose also provides various attributes and methods that allow us to access other metadata of the web page, such as the title, published date, authors, and more. You can explore the Goose library documentation for more information on how to access these metadata.

Python Goose is a powerful tool for content classification, as it allows us to extract the main text and metadata from web pages easily. By analyzing this extracted content, we can build models or apply classification algorithms to categorize web pages based on their content. This can be useful in tasks like news categorization, spam detection, sentiment analysis, and more.
