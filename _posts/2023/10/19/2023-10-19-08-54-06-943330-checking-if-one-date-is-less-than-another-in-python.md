In Python, you can compare dates using the comparison operators, such as `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=`. These operators work on `datetime` objects, which are provided by the `datetime` module.

To check if one date is less than another, you need to compare the two `datetime` objects using the `<` operator.

Here's an example:

```python
from datetime import datetime

date1 = datetime(2022, 1, 1)
date2 = datetime(2022, 2, 1)

if date1 < date2:
    print("date1 is less than date2")
else:
    print("date1 is greater than or equal to date2")
```

In the example above, `date1` represents January 1, 2022, and `date2` represents February 1, 2022. The comparison `date1 < date2` returns `True` because January comes before February.

You can also compare dates with different time components. For example, if you want to compare only the date portion and ignore the time, you can use the `date()` method:

```python
from datetime import datetime

date1 = datetime(2022, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)
date2 = datetime(2022, 1, 2, 8, 0, 0)

if date1.date() < date2.date():
    print("date1 is less than date2")
else:
    print("date1 is greater than or equal to date2")
```

In this example, the `date()` method is used to retrieve only the date portion of the `datetime` objects before comparison.

Keep in mind that when comparing dates, the comparison is based on the chronological order, not the length of time between the dates. For example, January 1, 2023, will be considered greater than January 1, 2022, even though there is only a one-day difference.

I hope this helps you understand how to check if one date is less than another in Python!
