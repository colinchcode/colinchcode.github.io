In Python, you can easily add or subtract a specific number of days to/from a date using the `datetime` module. This module provides various classes and methods to work with dates and times.

Here's an example of how you can add/subtract days to/from a date in Python:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Define the date
date = datetime(2022, 1, 1)

# Adding 5 days to the date
new_date = date + timedelta(days=5)
print(new_date)  # Output: 2022-01-06 00:00:00

# Subtracting 3 days from the date
new_date = date - timedelta(days=3)
print(new_date)  # Output: 2021-12-29 00:00:00
```

In the above code, we import the `datetime` class from the `datetime` module and the `timedelta` class from the `datetime` module. The `datetime` class represents a specific date and time, while the `timedelta` class represents a duration or difference between two dates.

We define the initial date using the `datetime` class constructor, specifying the year, month, and day. Then, we add or subtract a specific number of days using the `timedelta` class. The `days` parameter in the `timedelta` class specifies the number of days to add or subtract.

Finally, we print the new date after adding or subtracting the specified number of days.

Note that the output format includes the date and time. If you only want the date, you can use the `date()` method on the `datetime` object.

This is a simple way to add or subtract a specific number of days to/from a date in Python using the `datetime` module. By manipulating dates, you can easily perform operations such as calculating future or past dates, scheduling events, or performing date-based calculations in your Python programs.
