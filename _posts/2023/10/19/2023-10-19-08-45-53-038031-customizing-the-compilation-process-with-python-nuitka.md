Python Nuitka is a powerful tool that allows you to compile your Python code to standalone executables or binary libraries. It offers several customization options to optimize and tailor the compilation process to your specific needs. In this blog post, we will explore some of the key ways you can customize the compilation process using Python Nuitka.

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Python Nuitka compiles your Python code to C or C++ code and then further compiles it to machine code. This allows for faster execution and provides the ability to distribute your Python programs as stand-alone executables or shared libraries without requiring a Python interpreter.

## Optimization Options <a name="optimization"></a>
Python Nuitka provides various optimization options to control the behavior of the compilation process. These options allow you to optimize for speed or size, enable or disable specific optimization passes, and even customize the generated code.

For example, you can use the `--nofollow-imports` option to skip analyzing and including unused imported modules, reducing the size of the compiled executable. Similarly, the `--enable-plugin=` option allows you to enable specific optimization plugins provided by Python Nuitka, such as plugin for PySide2, Django, or NumPy.

## Module Exclusion <a name="module-exclusion"></a>
Sometimes, you might want to exclude certain modules from being included in the compiled output. This can be useful when working with large third-party libraries that are not required for your specific use case. Python Nuitka allows you to exclude modules using the `--nofollow-import-to=` option followed by the module name.

For example, to exclude the `numpy` module, you can use the following command:
```shell
nuitka --nofollow-import-to=numpy my_program.py
```

## Code Analysis and Inlining <a name="code-analysis"></a>
Python Nuitka performs static code analysis to optimize and improve the performance of your compiled code. One such optimization is inline function calls.

By default, Python Nuitka analyzes the code and automatically determines which functions can be safely inlined. However, you can also manually annotate functions using the `@nuitka.inlinehint` decorator to explicitly request inline optimization for a specific function.

```python
import nuitka

@nuitka.inlinehint
def my_inline_function(arg):
    # Code for the function

result = my_inline_function(42)
```

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Python Nuitka provides powerful customization options to optimize and tailor the compilation process according to your specific requirements. By utilizing optimization options, module exclusion, and code analysis, you can create efficient and standalone executables or binary libraries from your Python code.
