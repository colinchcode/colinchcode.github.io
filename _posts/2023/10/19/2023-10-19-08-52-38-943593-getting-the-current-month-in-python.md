In Python, there are several ways to obtain the current month. In this article, we will explore two common methods to achieve this.

## Method 1: Using the `datetime` Module

The `datetime` module in Python provides classes for working with dates and times. To get the current month, we can use the `datetime` module along with the `datetime` class.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use this method:

```python
from datetime import datetime

current_month = datetime.now().month
print("Current month:", current_month)
```

In the above code, we import the `datetime` module and then call the `now()` function to get the current date and time. We then access the `month` attribute of the resulting `datetime` object to obtain the current month. Finally, we print the current month.

## Method 2: Using the `calendar` Module

The `calendar` module in Python provides several useful functions and classes for working with calendars. We can utilize the `month_name` attribute of the `calendar` module to retrieve the name of the current month.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to use this method:

```python
import calendar

current_month_name = calendar.month_name[datetime.now().month]
print("Current month:", current_month_name)
```

In the above code, we import the `calendar` module and then access the `month_name` attribute to obtain the list of month names. We use the `datetime` module to get the current month, and then access the corresponding month name from the list using the current month as the index. Finally, we print the current month name.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored two different methods to get the current month in Python. Depending on your use case, you can choose the method that suits your needs best. The `datetime` module provides a straightforward approach, while the `calendar` module offers more flexibility, allowing you to work with different calendar functionalities.
