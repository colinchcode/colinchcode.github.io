## What is Python Goose?
Python Goose is a library written in Python that aims to extract the main text content from web pages. It is useful for tasks such as web scraping, content extraction, and SEO optimization. It uses a combination of heuristics and machine learning algorithms to determine the relevant content of a page.

## How to Install Python Goose
Installing Python Goose is simple. You can use `pip` to install the library:

```

## Extracting Main Text Content
Once you have Python Goose installed, you can start extracting the main text content from web pages. Here's a simple example:

```python

url = "https://www.example.com"
g = Goose()
article = g.extract(url)

print(article.cleaned_text)
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `Goose` class and provide a URL. The `extract` method is then used to extract the main text content from the webpage. Finally, the `cleaned_text` attribute is used to retrieve the extracted content.
