## Introduction
When you compile your Python code using Nuitka, you can enable the debug mode which allows you to get more information about your program's execution and potential issues. This can be beneficial when you need to identify and fix bugs in your code.

## Exposing the Debugging Features
To enable debugging features in Nuitka, you need to compile your Python code with the `--debug` option. This option generates additional debug information in the compiled code, making it easier to identify and locate bugs during runtime.

## Using the Debug Output
With debugging enabled, Nuitka provides a detailed output that can assist you in diagnosing issues in your program. This output includes information like the call stack, variable values, and error traces. By analyzing this information, you can easily pinpoint the source of the problem and take appropriate measures to fix it.

## Generating Debugging Info
In addition to the debug output during runtime, Nuitka also generates debugging information that can be helpful when using external tools to analyze and debug your compiled code. This includes generating source maps that can correlate the original source code with the compiled code, making it easier to trace back issues in the compiled executable.

## Conclusion
Python Nuitka offers powerful debugging features that can help you identify and resolve issues in your Python code. Enabling the debugging mode and utilizing the debug output along with the generated debugging information can greatly simplify the process of debugging and troubleshooting your Python applications.
