Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. In Python, we can create new classes based on existing classes using inheritance.

## Basic Inheritance Syntax

The basic syntax for creating an inherited class in Python is as follows:

```python
class BaseClass:
    # some attributes and methods

class DerivedClass(BaseClass):
    # additional attributes and methods
```

Here, `DerivedClass` is derived or inherited from `BaseClass`. `DerivedClass` will have all the attributes and methods of `BaseClass` in addition to any new attributes and methods defined within `DerivedClass`.

## Accessing Base Class Methods

In the derived class, we can access methods from the base class using the `super()` function. This allows us to invoke the base class methods and extend or override them if needed.

For example, let's create a `Rectangle` class as the base class and a `Square` class as the derived class inheriting from `Rectangle`:

```python
class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width

class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, side):
        super().__init__(side, side)

    def perimeter(self):
        return 4 * self.length
```

In the `Square` class, we inherited the `area()` method from the `Rectangle` class and defined a new `perimeter()` method.

## Method Overriding

Inheritance also allows us to override methods from the base class in the derived class. This allows us to modify the behavior of inherited methods according to the requirements of the derived class.

For example, let's modify the `area()` method in the `Square` class to calculate the area of a square instead of a rectangle:

```python
class Square(Rectangle):
    def __init__(self, side):
        super().__init__(side, side)

    def area(self):
        return self.length ** 2
```

Now, when we call the `area()` method on a `Square` object, it will return the area of the square instead of the area of a rectangle.

## Conclusion

Inheritance is a powerful feature in Python that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes. It promotes code reusability and helps create a hierarchy of related classes. By understanding the concept of inheritance, you can create more efficient and maintainable code in Python.
