In this tutorial, we will learn how to check if a date falls within a specific range in Python. We will be using the `datetime` module, which provides classes for manipulating dates and times.

Let's say we want to check if a given date is between a start date and an end date. Here's how we can do it:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def is_date_within_range(date, start_date, end_date):
    if start_date <= date <= end_date:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Example usage
date_to_check = datetime(2022, 5, 1)
start_date = datetime(2022, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(2022, 12, 31)

if is_date_within_range(date_to_check, start_date, end_date):
    print("Date is within the range")
else:
    print("Date is outside the range")
```

In the `is_date_within_range` function, we check if the `date` parameter is greater than or equal to the `start_date` and less than or equal to the `end_date`. If the condition is met, we return `True`, indicating that the date falls within the range. Otherwise, we return `False`.

In the example usage, we create a `date_to_check` variable with the date we want to check, and `start_date` and `end_date` variables representing the range. We then pass these variables to the `is_date_within_range` function, and based on the returned value, we print whether the date is within the range or not.

And that's it! You now know how to check if a date falls within a specific range in Python using the `datetime` module. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as validating user input or filtering data based on date ranges.

If you want to learn more about the `datetime` module, you can refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime-objects).
