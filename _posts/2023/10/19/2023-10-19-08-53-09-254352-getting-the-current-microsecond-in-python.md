In Python, you can easily obtain the current microsecond using the `datetime` module. The `datetime` module provides various functions and classes to work with dates and times.

Here's an example of how to get the current microsecond in Python:

```python
import datetime

# Get the current datetime
current_datetime = datetime.datetime.now()

# Extract the microsecond component
microsecond = current_datetime.microsecond

print(f"Current microsecond: {microsecond}")
```

In the above code, we import the `datetime` module and use the `datetime.now()` function to get the current datetime object. We then extract the microsecond component using the `microsecond` attribute. Finally, we print the obtained microsecond value.

This code will output the current microsecond value when you run it.

It's important to note that the `microsecond` attribute returns a value between 0 and 999999, representing the microsecond component of the datetime. If you need to work with time intervals or high-resolution timing, the `time` module provides more precise options.
