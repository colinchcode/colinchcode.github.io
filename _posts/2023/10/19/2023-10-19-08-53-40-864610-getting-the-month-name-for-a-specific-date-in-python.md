In Python, you can easily get the month name for a specific date using the `datetime` module. The `datetime` module provides various methods and attributes for working with dates and times.

To get the month name for a specific date, follow these steps:

1. Import the `datetime` module:

```python
import datetime
```

2. Create a `datetime` object for the specific date:

```python
date = datetime.datetime(2022, 9, 15)
```

Replace `2022`, `9`, and `15` with the desired year, month, and day for your specific date.

3. Use the `strftime` method to format the date and retrieve the month name:

```python
month_name = date.strftime('%B')
```

The `%B` format specifier is used to get the full month name.

Here's a complete example:

```python
import datetime

date = datetime.datetime(2022, 9, 15)
month_name = date.strftime('%B')

print(f"The month name for {date} is {month_name}.")
```

Output:

```
The month name for 2022-09-15 is September.
```

That's it! Now you know how to get the month name for a specific date in Python using the `datetime` module.

For more information, refer to the [Python datetime documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html).
