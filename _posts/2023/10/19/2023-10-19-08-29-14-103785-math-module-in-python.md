The `math` module in Python provides a set of mathematical functions that can be used to perform complex mathematical operations. It is a part of the standard library and does not require any additional installation.

To use the `math` module, you need to import it at the beginning of your code:

```python
import math
```

Once imported, you can access a variety of mathematical functions and constants. Here are some commonly used functions:

## 1. Trigonometric Functions

- `math.sin(x)`: Returns the sine of x (where x is in radians).
- `math.cos(x)`: Returns the cosine of x (where x is in radians).
- `math.tan(x)`: Returns the tangent of x (where x is in radians).
- `math.radians(degrees)`: Converts degrees to radians.
- `math.degrees(radians)`: Converts radians to degrees.

## 2. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions

- `math.exp(x)`: Returns e raised to the power of x.
- `math.log(x)`: Returns the natural logarithm of x.
- `math.log10(x)`: Returns the base-10 logarithm of x.

## 3. Power and Square Root Functions

- `math.sqrt(x)`: Returns the square root of x.
- `math.pow(x, y)`: Returns x raised to the power of y.

## 4. Constants

- `math.pi`: The mathematical constant pi (Ï€), accurate to about 15 decimal places.
- `math.e`: The mathematical constant e, accurate to about 15 decimal places.

## Example Usage

Let's see some example usages to understand how to utilize the `math` module:

```python
import math

# Trigonometric functions
angle = math.radians(45)
print(math.sin(angle))  # Output: 0.7071067811865475
print(math.cos(angle))  # Output: 0.7071067811865476
print(math.tan(angle))  # Output: 0.9999999999999999

# Exponential and logarithmic functions
print(math.exp(2))      # Output: 7.3890560989306495
print(math.log(10))     # Output: 2.302585092994046

# Power and square root functions
print(math.sqrt(25))    # Output: 5.0
print(math.pow(2, 3))   # Output: 8.0

# Constants
print(math.pi)          # Output: 3.141592653589793
print(math.e)           # Output: 2.718281828459045
```

These are just a few examples of the functions provided by the `math` module. There are several other functions available that can be useful for various mathematical calculations.

For more details, you can refer to the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html).
