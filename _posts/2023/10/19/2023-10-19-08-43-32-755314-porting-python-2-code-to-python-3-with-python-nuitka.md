If you have a Python 2 codebase that you want to migrate to Python 3, you may encounter compatibility issues. One tool that can help with this process is Python Nuitka.

Python Nuitka is a Python compiler that allows you to compile your Python code into native machine code, which can result in improved performance and compatibility. It supports both Python 2 and Python 3, making it an ideal choice for porting Python 2 code to Python 3.

Here are the steps to port your Python 2 code to Python 3 using Python Nuitka:

1. Install Python Nuitka:
   ```
   pip install nuitka
   ```

2. Compile your Python 2 code with Python Nuitka:
   ```
   python -m nuitka --recurse-all your_script.py
   ```

   This command will compile your Python 2 code and generate an executable file. The `--recurse-all` option ensures that all imported modules are also compiled.

3. Test the compiled code:
   ```
   ./your_script.bin
   ```

   Make sure to test your code thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected after the compilation.

4. Modify the code to work with Python 3:
   When porting your Python 2 code to Python 3, you may need to make some changes to ensure compatibility. Common areas where changes are required include:

   - `print` statements: In Python 2, `print` is a statement, whereas in Python 3, it is a function. You'll need to update your `print` statements to use parentheses.

   - `unicode` and `str` types: Python 3 uses Unicode by default, whereas Python 2 has separate `str` and `unicode` types. You'll need to update your code to work with Unicode strings.

   - `range` and `xrange`: In Python 2, there are two functions for creating ranges: `range` and `xrange`. In Python 3, `xrange` is no longer available, and `range` functions like `xrange`. You'll need to replace `xrange` with `range` in your code.

   These are just a few examples, and you may need to make additional changes depending on the specific codebase.

5. Repeat steps 2 and 3:
   After making the necessary modifications, recompile your code using Python Nuitka and test it again to ensure that it is working correctly.

By following these steps and using Python Nuitka, you can make the process of porting your Python 2 codebase to Python 3 smoother and more efficient. However, keep in mind that Python Nuitka may not support all Python features and modules, so it's essential to test your code thoroughly and make any necessary adjustments.
