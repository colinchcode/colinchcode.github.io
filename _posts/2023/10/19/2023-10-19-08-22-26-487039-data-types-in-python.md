In Python, data types are used to classify the types of values that can be stored and manipulated. Python has several built-in data types, including:

1. **Numeric Data Types**
    - Integers (`int`): whole numbers without a decimal point.
    - Floating-Point Numbers (`float`): numbers with a decimal point or exponential notation.

2. **Sequence Data Types**
    - Strings (`str`): a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").
    - Lists (`list`): an ordered collection of objects enclosed in square brackets ([]).
    - Tuples (`tuple`): an ordered collection of objects enclosed in round brackets (()).
    
3. **Mapping Data Type**
    - Dictionary (`dict`): an unordered collection of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces ({}) where keys are unique.

4. **Boolean Data Type**
    - Boolean (`bool`): represents the truth values `True` or `False`.

5. **Set Data Type**
    - Set (`set`): an unordered collection of unique elements enclosed in curly braces ({}) or created using the `set()` constructor.
    
Let's explore these data types in more detail.

## Numeric Data Types

### Integers (`int`)
Integers represent whole numbers. They can be positive, negative, or zero. For example:
```python
x = 5
y = -10
z = 0
```

### Floating-Point Numbers (`float`)
Floating-point numbers represent real numbers with a decimal point or exponential notation. For example:
```python
a = 3.14
b = -2.5
c = 1.23e-4
```

## Sequence Data Types

### Strings (`str`)
Strings represent a sequence of characters. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes (""). For example:
```python
name = "John Doe"
message = 'Hello, World!'
```

### Lists (`list`)
Lists are ordered collections of objects enclosed in square brackets ([]). Elements can be of different data types. For example:
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = [1, 'apple', True, 3.14]
```

### Tuples (`tuple`)
Tuples are similar to lists but are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. Tuples are enclosed in round brackets and elements can be of different data types. For example:
```python
person = ('John', 25, 'New York')
coordinates = (51.5074, -0.1278)
```

## Mapping Data Type

### Dictionary (`dict`)
Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces. Keys are unique and used to access the corresponding values. For example:
```python
person = {'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```

## Boolean Data Type

### Boolean (`bool`)
Booleans represent the truth values `True` or `False`. They are used in logical operations and conditional statements. For example:
```python
is_python_cool = True
is_raining = False
```

## Set Data Type

### Set (`set`)
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements enclosed in curly braces or created using the `set()` constructor. They are useful for removing duplicates or performing mathematical set operations. For example:
```python
fruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'orange'}
numbers = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
```

These are the basic data types in Python. Understanding and using the appropriate data types is crucial for efficient programming. For more information, refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html).
