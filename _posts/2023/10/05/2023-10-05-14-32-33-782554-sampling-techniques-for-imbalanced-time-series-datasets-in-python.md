Handling imbalanced datasets is a common challenge in machine learning, especially when dealing with time series data. An imbalanced time series dataset refers to a dataset in which the target variable is not evenly distributed across different time points. In such cases, the majority class dominates the data, leading to biased models.

In this blog post, we will explore different sampling techniques that can be used to address imbalanced time series datasets in Python. We will cover the following methods:

1. Up-sampling
2. Down-sampling
3. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)
4. Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN)
5. Random Under-sampling Examples (RUS)
6. Time series-specific techniques

## Up-sampling

Up-sampling is a technique where the minority class is replicated or synthetically generated to achieve a balanced distribution. This method increases the number of instances in the minority class, allowing the model to learn from more samples.

One popular up-sampling technique for time series data is the **SMOTE-NC**, which uses synthetic minority oversampling with the time series-specific variant of SMOTE.

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTENC

# Upsample minority class using SMOTE-NC
smote_nc = SMOTENC(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote_nc.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

## Down-sampling

Down-sampling involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to match the number of instances in the minority class. This technique helps to eliminate the bias caused by the majority class while retaining a balanced distribution.

The following code demonstrates how to perform down-sampling using the **RandomUnderSampler** algorithm:

```python
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler

# Downsample majority class using RandomUnderSampler
rus = RandomUnderSampler(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = rus.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

## SMOTE

Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is a widely used algorithm for generating synthetic samples of the minority class. It works by interpolating between two actual instances of the minority class, generating new observations along the line connecting them.

To apply SMOTE to time series data, we can use the **SMOTE-TS** algorithm.

```python
from sktime.over_sampling import SMOTETimeSeriesBased

smote_ts = SMOTETimeSeriesBased(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = smote_ts.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

## ADASYN

Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) is an extension of SMOTE that adaptively generates synthetic samples based on the level of minority class difficulty. It generates more synthetic samples for difficult, borderline instances and fewer for easy ones.

Here's how you can use ADASYN to up-sample imbalanced time series data:

```python
from imblearn.over_sampling import ADASYN

adasyn = ADASYN(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = adasyn.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

## RUS

Random Under-sampling Examples (RUS) randomly selects a subset of majority class instances to equalize the class distributions. It is a straightforward and computationally efficient method for handling imbalanced time series datasets.

Let's see how to use RUS for down-sampling:

```python
from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler

rus = RandomUnderSampler(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = rus.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

## Time Series-Specific Techniques

Apart from the general sampling techniques, there are time series-specific methods that consider the temporal aspect of the data. Some of these techniques include using sliding window approaches, segmenting the time series into smaller chunks, and applying resampling techniques to each segment individually.

One prominent time series-specific sampling technique is **TimeSeriesOverSampler**, which generates synthetic samples based on time series-specific patterns.

```python
from tslearn.generators import TimeSeriesGenerator
from sktime.datasets import load_gunpoint

X_train, y_train = load_gunpoint(return_X_y=True)

# Apply TimeSeriesOverSampler
tso = TimeSeriesOverSampler(random_state=42)
X_train_resampled, y_train_resampled = tso.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)
```

## Conclusion

Handling imbalanced time series datasets is crucial for building accurate and unbiased models. In this blog post, we explored various sampling techniques, including up-sampling, down-sampling, SMOTE, ADASYN, and time series-specific methods.

By employing these techniques, you can address the imbalance issues in your time series data and improve the performance of your machine learning models. Remember to choose the most suitable technique based on your dataset and domain knowledge.
