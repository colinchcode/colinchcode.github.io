## Introduction to Computer Vision

Computer vision is the field of study that focuses on enabling machines to "see" and understand visual data, such as images and videos. It involves extracting meaningful information from images and making decisions based on that information. TensorFlow provides various tools and APIs that can be leveraged to build powerful computer vision models.

## Object Detection

Object detection is the task of detecting and localizing objects within an image. TensorFlow's Object Detection API is a great resource for implementing object detection models. It provides pre-trained models that can be fine-tuned on custom datasets. By using transfer learning, we can leverage these pre-trained models to quickly build accurate object detection systems.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from object_detection.utils import label_map_util
from object_detection.utils import visualization_utils as viz_utils

# Load the pre-trained object detection model
pipeline = tf.saved_model.load(PATH_TO_MODEL)
model = pipeline.signatures["serving_default"]
category_index = label_map_util.create_category_index_from_labelmap(PATH_TO_LABELS, use_display_name=True)

# Perform object detection on an image
image_np = load_image(PATH_TO_IMAGE)
input_tensor = tf.convert_to_tensor(image_np)
input_tensor = input_tensor[tf.newaxis, ...]
detections = model(input_tensor)

# Visualize the detected objects
viz_utils.visualize_boxes_and_labels_on_image_array(
    image_np,
    detections['detection_boxes'][0].numpy(),
    detections['detection_classes'][0].numpy().astype(int),
    detections['detection_scores'][0].numpy(),
    category_index,
    use_normalized_coordinates=True,
    max_boxes_to_draw=200,
    min_score_thresh=0.5,
    agnostic_mode=False)

# Save and display the annotated image
save_image(image_np, OUTPUT_PATH)
display_image(image_np)
```

## Image Classification

Image classification involves assigning a label or a category to an input image. TensorFlow provides pre-trained models, such as Inception and MobileNet, that can be used for image classification tasks. These models can be easily loaded and fine-tuned on custom datasets.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
from tensorflow.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input, decode_predictions

# Load the pre-trained image classification model
model = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.ResNet50(weights='imagenet')

# Load and preprocess the input image
img = image.load_img(IMAGE_PATH, target_size=(224, 224))
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)
img_array = tf.expand_dims(img_array, 0)
img_array = preprocess_input(img_array)

# Perform image classification
predictions = model.predict(img_array)
decoded_predictions = decode_predictions(predictions)

# Print the top 3 predicted labels
for _, label, confidence in decoded_predictions[0][:3]:
    print(f"{label}: {confidence}")
```

## Image Segmentation

Image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple segments, with each segment representing a distinct object or region. TensorFlow provides various models, such as DeepLab, for image segmentation tasks. These models can be used to perform semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, or panoptic segmentation.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow_examples.models.pix2pix import pix2pix

# Load the pre-trained image segmentation model
base_model = tf.keras.applications.MobileNetV2(input_shape=IMG_SHAPE, include_top=False)
model = pix2pix.unet.UnetModel(base_model, num_classes=NUM_CLASSES)

# Load and preprocess the input image
image = tf.io.read_file(IMAGE_PATH)
image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
image = tf.image.resize(image, IMG_SIZE)
image = tf.expand_dims(image, 0)
image = image / 255.0  # Normalize the image

# Perform image segmentation
prediction = model.predict(image)
segmentation = tf.argmax(prediction, axis=-1)

# Visualize the segmented image
plt.imshow(tf.squeeze(segmentation))
plt.axis('off')
plt.show()
```
