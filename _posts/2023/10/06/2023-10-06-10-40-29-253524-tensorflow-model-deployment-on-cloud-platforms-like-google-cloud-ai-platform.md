## What is Google Cloud AI Platform?

Google Cloud AI Platform is a fully managed cloud platform that enables you to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. It provides a seamless environment for hosting your models and serving predictions. Google Cloud AI Platform supports various machine learning frameworks, including TensorFlow.

## Steps for TensorFlow Model Deployment

### Preparing your TensorFlow Model

Before deploying your TensorFlow model on Google Cloud AI Platform, make sure you have a trained model ready for deployment. This model should be saved in the SavedModel format, which is a universal format for saving TensorFlow models.

### Creating a Model Repository on Google Cloud AI Platform

The first step is to create a model repository on Google Cloud AI Platform, where you can store and manage your models. Follow these steps to create a model repository:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project if you haven't already.
2. Enable the AI Platform API for your project.
3. Navigate to the AI Platform section in the console and click on "Models".
4. Click on "New Model" to create a new model repository.

### Uploading the TensorFlow Model

After creating a model repository, you need to upload your TensorFlow model to the repository. Follow these steps to upload the model:

1. In the model repository view, click on your model to open its details page.
2. Click on "Add Version" to add a new version of the model.
3. Specify the location of the SavedModel directory on your local machine.
4. Click on "Save" to upload the TensorFlow model to Google Cloud AI Platform.

### Configuring the Model Version

Next, you need to configure the version of the TensorFlow model by specifying the runtime configuration. This includes details such as the machine type, number of instances, and serving runtime. Follow these steps to configure the model version:

1. In the model details page, click on the version you uploaded to open its details page.
2. Click on "Edit Configuration" to configure the runtime options.
3. Specify the desired configuration options and click on "Save" to apply the changes.

### Deploying the TensorFlow Model

Now that your TensorFlow model is uploaded and configured, you can finally deploy it on Google Cloud AI Platform. Follow these steps to deploy the model:

1. In the model version details page, click on "Deploy".
2. Provide a name for the deployment and click on "Save" to start the deployment process.
3. Wait for the deployment to complete. Once it's done, you will receive a deployment URL that you can use to make predictions.

## Conclusion

Deploying TensorFlow models on cloud platforms like Google Cloud AI Platform offers a scalable and efficient way to serve predictions. In this blog post, we explored the steps involved in deploying a TensorFlow model on Google Cloud AI Platform. By following these steps, you can easily deploy your own TensorFlow models and leverage the power of cloud-based machine learning infrastructure.
