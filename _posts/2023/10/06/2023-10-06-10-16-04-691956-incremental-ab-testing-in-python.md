A/B testing is a common technique used in product development to compare and evaluate two or more versions of a feature or design. Traditionally, A/B tests are conducted by randomly dividing users into different groups and measuring the impact of each variation on a chosen metric. However, as the size of your user base grows, segmenting a larger percentage of users into distinct groups can become impractical or costly.

In such cases, incremental A/B testing provides a solution by gradually rolling out the new feature to a percentage of users and dynamically adjusting the rollout based on observed results. This approach allows you to continuously learn and make data-driven decisions without impacting a large portion of your user base.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement incremental A/B testing in Python using the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries.

## Defining the Test and Control Groups

To conduct an incremental A/B test, we need to define the test and control groups. In this example, let's say we want to test a new pricing model for a subscription-based service. We will randomly assign a percentage of users to the test group and the remaining users to the control group.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Define the size of the test and control group
test_group_size = int(0.2 * total_users)
control_group_size = total_users - test_group_size

# Randomly assign users to the test and control groups
all_users = np.arange(total_users)
np.random.shuffle(all_users)

test_group = all_users[:test_group_size]
control_group = all_users[test_group_size:]

# Store the groups in a DataFrame for easy manipulation
groups = pd.DataFrame({'user_id': all_users,
                       'group': np.where(np.isin(all_users, test_group), 'test', 'control')})
```

## Defining the Metric

Next, we need to define the metric that will be used to evaluate the performance of the new pricing model. In this example, let's assume the metric is the conversion rate, which is the percentage of users who subscribe to the service after seeing the new pricing.

```python
# Generate mock conversion rate data for each user
groups['conversion_rate'] = np.where(groups['group'] == 'test', np.random.uniform(0.05, 0.1), np.random.uniform(0.1, 0.15))
```

## Running the Experiment

We will now simulate the incremental A/B test by gradually rolling out the new pricing model to a percentage of the test group and tracking the conversion rate.

```python
# Initialize the rollout percentage
rollout_percentage = 0.1

# Calculate the number of users to rollout based on the current rollout percentage
users_to_rollout = int(rollout_percentage * test_group_size)

# Track the cumulative conversion rate
cumulative_conversion_rate = []

# Simulate the incremental rollout
for i in range(users_to_rollout):
    # Get the current users in test group
    current_test_users = test_group[:i+1]
    
    # Update the conversion rate for the users in the test group
    groups.loc[groups['user_id'].isin(current_test_users), 'conversion_rate'] = np.random.uniform(0.15, 0.2)
    
    # Calculate the cumulative conversion rate
    cumulative_conversion_rate.append(groups.loc[groups['group'] == 'test', 'conversion_rate'].mean())
```

## Evaluating the Results

Finally, we can evaluate the results of the incremental A/B test by plotting the cumulative conversion rate over time.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the cumulative conversion rate over time
plt.plot(range(1, users_to_rollout + 1), cumulative_conversion_rate)
plt.xlabel('Number of Users Rolled Out')
plt.ylabel('Cumulative Conversion Rate')
plt.title('Incremental A/B Test - Cumulative Conversion Rate')
plt.show()
```

By analyzing the plot, you can observe how the conversion rate changes as the rollout progresses. This information can help you make decisions on whether to continue rolling out the new pricing model or make adjustments based on observed results.

In conclusion, incremental A/B testing provides a practical approach to conduct experiments and evaluate variations in a controlled manner, especially when dealing with large user bases. Python, with its libraries like `numpy` and `pandas`, provides a convenient environment for implementing and analyzing such tests effectively.
