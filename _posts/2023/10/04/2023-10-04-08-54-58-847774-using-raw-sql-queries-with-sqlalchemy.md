When working with databases in Python, SQLAlchemy is a popular choice due to its powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) capabilities. However, there are times when writing raw SQL queries becomes necessary, especially for complex queries or when dealing with database-specific features.

In this blog post, we will explore how to execute raw SQL queries using SQLAlchemy. We will assume that you already have a basic understanding of SQLAlchemy and have a connection to a database.

## Executing Raw SQL Queries

To execute raw SQL queries with SQLAlchemy, we can make use of the `execute()` method provided by the database connection object. This method allows us to execute any valid SQL query directly.

Here's an example of executing a simple SELECT query:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to connect to the database
engine = create_engine('database://user:password@host:port/database_name')

# Execute a raw SQL SELECT query
result = engine.execute("SELECT * FROM table_name")
```

The `execute()` method returns a `ResultProxy` object, which allows you to fetch the results of the query using methods like `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, or `fetchmany()`.

## Executing Parametrized Queries

Parametrized queries are a good practice to prevent SQL injection attacks and improve query performance by reusing already parsed query plans. SQLAlchemy provides a convenient way to execute parametrized queries using the `text()` function.

Here's an example of executing a parametrized query:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, text

# Create an engine to connect to the database
engine = create_engine('database://user:password@host:port/database_name')

# Define a parametrized query
query = text("SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column = :value")

# Execute the query with parameters
result = engine.execute(query, value='some_value')
```

By using the `text()` function, we can define our SQL query with placeholders represented by the `:parameter_name` syntax. These placeholders can then be passed as keyword arguments in the `execute()` method.

## Mapping SQL Results to Objects

One of the advantages of using an ORM like SQLAlchemy is the ability to easily map SQL query results to Python objects. However, when executing raw SQL queries, mapping the results manually is necessary.

Here's an example of mapping SQL results to objects:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to connect to the database
engine = create_engine('database://user:password@host:port/database_name')

# Execute a raw SQL SELECT query
result = engine.execute("SELECT * FROM table_name")

# Iterate over the query results
for row in result:
    # Map the row data to an object or use it directly
    object_attribute = row.column_name
```

The `row` object represents a single row retrieved from the query results. You can access individual column values using the column names as attributes.

## Conclusion

While SQLAlchemy's ORM provides a convenient way to interact with databases, there are scenarios where executing raw SQL queries becomes necessary. In this blog post, we explored how to execute raw SQL queries using SQLAlchemy, including parametrized queries and mapping query results to objects.

By leveraging the flexibility of SQLAlchemy, you can benefit from both the convenience of an ORM and the power of raw SQL queries to handle complex database operations.
