Energy system planning involves making decisions about the design, operation, and investment in energy infrastructure to meet the current and future energy demands. It is important to assess the uncertainties and risks associated with the energy system to make informed decisions. One technique used for assessing uncertainties is Monte Carlo simulation.

**Monte Carlo simulation** is a statistical method that uses random sampling to model and analyze complex systems. It allows us to evaluate the performance of a system under different scenarios by generating multiple random inputs and running simulations. In this blog post, we will explore how Monte Carlo simulation can be used for energy system planning.

## Introduction to Monte Carlo Simulation

Monte Carlo simulation involves the following steps:

1. Define the problem statement: Clearly define the problem and the variables that need to be modeled.

2. Define probability distributions: Specify the probability distributions of the input variables. These distributions describe the likelihood of different values occurring for each variable.

3. Generate random samples: Randomly sample values from the specified distributions for each input variable.

4. Run simulations: Use the sampled values as input to the simulation model and run the model multiple times to generate an output for each simulation.

5. Analyze results: Analyze the output data from the simulations to understand the performance of the system under different scenarios and identify key insights.

## Energy System Planning with Monte Carlo Simulation

In energy system planning, Monte Carlo simulation can be used to assess uncertainties and risks associated with various factors, including energy demand, fuel prices, environmental policies, and technology costs. By modeling these uncertainties, we can better understand the potential outcomes and make more informed decisions.

Here is an example of how we can use Monte Carlo simulation for energy system planning:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define probability distributions for input variables
demand_mean = 1000  # Mean energy demand in MWh/year
demand_std = 100    # Standard deviation of energy demand
fuel_price_mean = 3  # Mean fuel price in $/MMBtu
fuel_price_std = 0.5  # Standard deviation of fuel price

# Generate random samples
num_samples = 1000
demand_samples = np.random.normal(demand_mean, demand_std, num_samples)
fuel_price_samples = np.random.normal(fuel_price_mean, fuel_price_std, num_samples)

# Run simulations
total_cost = []
for i in range(num_samples):
    # Run simulation for each sample
    # Calculate the cost for the energy system based on the inputs
    
    total_cost.append(cost)

# Analyze results
average_cost = np.mean(total_cost)
std_dev_cost = np.std(total_cost)
```

In the above example, we define probability distributions for two input variables: energy demand and fuel price. We generate random samples from these distributions using the `numpy.random.normal` function. We then run simulations for each sample, calculate the cost of the energy system based on the input values, and store the results in the `total_cost` list. Finally, we analyze the results by calculating the average cost and standard deviation of the cost.

By running the Monte Carlo simulation multiple times with different random samples, we can obtain a range of possible outcomes for the cost of the energy system. This helps us understand the uncertainty and risks associated with the planning decisions.

## Conclusion

Monte Carlo simulation is a valuable technique for assessing uncertainties and risks in energy system planning. It allows us to model and analyze complex systems, such as energy infrastructure, by generating multiple random inputs and running simulations. By understanding the potential outcomes, decision-makers can make informed decisions and mitigate risks.
