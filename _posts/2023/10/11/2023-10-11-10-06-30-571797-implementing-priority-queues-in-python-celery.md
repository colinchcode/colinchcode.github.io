Python Celery is a powerful distributed task queue system that allows you to distribute tasks across multiple workers. While Celery supports default FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues, there may be cases where you need to prioritize certain tasks over others. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement priority queues in Python Celery.

## Understanding Priority Queues

Priority queues are data structures that prioritize elements based on a certain criterion. In Celery, priority queues allow you to assign different priorities to tasks and process the higher priority tasks first. This can be useful when you have critical or time-sensitive tasks that need to be processed immediately, while lower priority tasks can wait.

## Implementing Priority Queues in Celery

Celery provides a way to implement priority queues by using multiple queues and dynamically routing tasks based on priority. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to implement priority queues in Celery:

### Step 1: Define Queues

First, you need to define the different queues based on their priorities. For example, you can have three queues with different priorities: high, medium, and low. You can define them in your Celery configuration file (`celeryconfig.py`) as follows:

```python
task_queues = {
    'high_priority': {
        'exchange': 'high_priority',
        'routing_key': 'high_priority',
    },
    'medium_priority': {
        'exchange': 'medium_priority',
        'routing_key': 'medium_priority',
    },
    'low_priority': {
        'exchange': 'low_priority',
        'routing_key': 'low_priority',
    },
}
```

### Step 2: Define Task Routing

Next, you need to define the routing logic for your tasks to be directed to the appropriate queues based on their priority. Add the following code to your Celery configuration file:

```python
task_routes = {
    'your_app.tasks.high_priority_task': {
        'queue': 'high_priority',
    },
    'your_app.tasks.medium_priority_task': {
        'queue': 'medium_priority',
    },
    'your_app.tasks.low_priority_task': {
        'queue': 'low_priority',
    },
}
```

Make sure to replace `your_app.tasks` with the actual path to your task modules.

### Step 3: Decorate Tasks with Priority

Finally, you need to decorate your task functions with the priority level. For example, let's say you have a high priority task `high_priority_task`:

```python
from your_app.celery import app

@app.task
def high_priority_task():
    # Task logic goes here
    pass
```

To assign high priority to this task, you can use the `@app.task` decorator with the `queue` parameter:

```python
@app.task(queue='high_priority')
def high_priority_task():
    # Task logic goes here
    pass
```

Similarly, you can decorate other tasks with the appropriate priority queues.

## Conclusion

Implementing priority queues in Python Celery allows you to handle tasks based on their importance and process them accordingly. By defining multiple queues, routing tasks based on priority, and decorating tasks with the desired priority level, you can achieve a well-organized task processing system.

Celery offers great flexibility and scalability, making it an excellent choice for managing task queues, including priority queues, in Python-based applications.
