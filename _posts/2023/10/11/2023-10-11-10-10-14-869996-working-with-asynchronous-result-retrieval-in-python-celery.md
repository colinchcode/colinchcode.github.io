Python Celery is a widely-used distributed task queue library that allows you to run tasks asynchronously across multiple workers. It provides a convenient way to execute time-consuming tasks without blocking the main application.

One of the key features of Celery is its ability to handle asynchronous result retrieval. This allows you to submit a task for execution and then check the result later, without blocking the current process. In this blog post, we will discuss how to work with asynchronous result retrieval in Python Celery.

## Setting up Celery

Before we dive into working with asynchronous result retrieval, let's quickly go over the basic setup for Celery. 

First, make sure you have installed Celery by running `pip install celery` in your Python environment.

Next, create a new Python module called `tasks.py` and import the necessary modules:

```python
from celery import Celery

# Create a Celery instance
app = Celery('myapp', broker='amqp://guest@localhost//', backend='rpc://')
```

Here, we create a Celery instance named `app` and set the broker and backend URLs. The broker URL specifies the message broker to use, which is responsible for sending and receiving messages between the Celery workers and the main application. The backend URL specifies the result backend, where task results are stored.

## Submitting a task

To submit a task for execution, define a function and decorate it with the `@app.task` decorator:

```python
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

In this example, we define a simple `add()` function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

## Retrieving task result

To retrieve the result of an asynchronously executed task, you can use the `AsyncResult` class.

```python
from tasks import add

# Submit a task for execution
result = add.delay(4, 6)

# Retrieve the result
print(result.get())
```

Here, `result` is an instance of the `AsyncResult` class. The `get()` method blocks the current process until the result is available and then returns the result.

## Checking task status

In addition to retrieving the result, you can also check the status of an asynchronously executed task. The status can be one of the following:

- `PENDING`: The task is waiting for execution.
- `STARTED`: The task has been picked up by a worker and is currently running.
- `SUCCESS`: The task has completed successfully.
- `FAILURE`: The task has failed.

To check the status of a task, you can use the `status` attribute of the `AsyncResult` instance:

```python
print(result.status)
```

You can also use the `ready()` method to check if the task has been completed:

```python
if result.ready():
    print("Task completed")
else:
    print("Task still in progress")
```

You can use these status checks to implement custom logic based on the progress of the task.

## Conclusion

Asynchronous result retrieval is an important feature of Python Celery, allowing you to execute time-consuming tasks in a non-blocking manner. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily submit tasks, retrieve their results, and check their statuses. This enables you to build highly efficient and scalable applications that can handle heavy workloads. Happy coding!
