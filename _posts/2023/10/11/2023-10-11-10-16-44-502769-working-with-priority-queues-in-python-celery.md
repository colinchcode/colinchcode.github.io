Python Celery is a powerful distributed task queue system that allows you to distribute tasks across multiple workers. It provides various features to manage and prioritize tasks, including the use of priority queues. In this blog post, we will explore how to work with priority queues in Python Celery.

## What are priority queues?

A **priority queue** is a data structure that holds elements with associated priorities. The priority of an element determines the order in which it will be processed or consumed. Elements with higher priorities are processed before elements with lower priorities.

Priority queues are commonly used in scenarios where different tasks have different levels of importance or urgency. For example, in a task management system, you may want to process high-priority tasks before low-priority ones.

## Setting up Celery

To get started, you need to install Celery using pip:

```
pip install celery
```

Next, you'll need to define a Celery application and configure it. Here's an example setup:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('myapp', broker='amqp://guest@localhost//', backend='rpc://')

@app.task
def my_task():
    # Task code here
```

In this example, we create a Celery application named 'myapp' and configure it to use the RabbitMQ message broker and the RPC result backend. You can replace these with your preferred broker and backend.

## Using priority queues

Celery provides a built-in priority queue implementation called `PriorityQueue`. You can use this queue to enqueue tasks with different priorities. To use a priority queue, you need to define a custom task class that extends `celery.Task` and set the `priority` attribute for each task.

Here's an example of a custom task class using a priority queue:

```python
from celery import Task

class PriorityTask(Task):
    priority = 0

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Task execution logic here
```

In this example, the `PriorityTask` class extends `celery.Task` and defines a `priority` attribute with a default value of 0. You can change this value to assign a different priority to each task.

## Defining task priorities

To enqueue a task with a specific priority, you can instantiate the custom task class and set the `priority` attribute before calling the task:

```python
task = PriorityTask()
task.priority = 10
task.apply_async(args=(arg1, arg2), kwargs={'foo': 'bar'})
```

In this example, we instantiate a `PriorityTask` object and set its `priority` attribute to 10. We then call the task using `apply_async` with the required arguments and keyword arguments.

## Consuming tasks from the priority queue

To consume tasks from the priority queue, you need to start Celery workers and configure them to process tasks from the priority queue. You can specify the queue name using the `--queues` option when starting the worker:

```
celery -A myapp worker --queues priority_queue
```

In this example, we start a Celery worker for the `myapp` application and configure it to consume tasks from the `priority_queue`.

## Conclusion

Priority queues in Python Celery allow you to manage and prioritize tasks effectively. By assigning different priorities to tasks, you can ensure that important tasks are processed earlier. Setting up and using priority queues in Celery is straightforward and provides flexibility in task scheduling.
