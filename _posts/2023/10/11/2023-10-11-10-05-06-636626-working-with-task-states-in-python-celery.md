Asynchronous task processing is a crucial aspect of many applications, and Celery is a popular choice for implementing task queues in Python. One of the key features of Celery is its ability to handle task states, which allows you to track the progress and status of your tasks. In this article, we will explore how to work with task states in Python Celery.

## Introduction to Task States

In Celery, a task can have various states throughout its lifecycle. These states provide information about the progress and status of the task. Some of the common task states in Celery include:

- `PENDING`: The task is waiting to be executed.
- `STARTED`: The task has been started.
- `SUCCESS`: The task has successfully completed.
- `FAILURE`: The task has failed.
- `RETRY`: The task failed but will be retried.
- `REVOKED`: The task has been revoked.

## Tracking Task States

In order to track the states of your tasks, you need to enable the `task_track_started` setting in your Celery configuration. This setting ensures that the tasks emit start and completion events, which are used to update the task states.

```python
# celeryconfig.py

CELERY_TASK_TRACK_STARTED = True
```

Once you have enabled task tracking, you can access the `state` attribute of a task to get its current state.

```python
from celery import current_app

app = current_app()
task = app.tasks['task_name']
state = task.AsyncResult(task_id).state
```

## Handling Task States

There are several ways to handle task states in Celery. One approach is to use Celery's built-in events mechanism to listen for task events and perform actions based on the task state.

```python
from celery import signals

@signals.task_postrun.connect
def handle_task_postrun(sender=None, task_id=None, **kwargs):
    task_result = sender.AsyncResult(task_id)

    if task_result.state == 'SUCCESS':
        # Handle successful task completion
        pass
    elif task_result.state == 'FAILURE':
        # Handle task failure
        pass
```

Another way to handle task states is by polling the task state at regular intervals, using `AsyncResult`.

```python
from celery.result import AsyncResult

task_result = AsyncResult(task_id)
while task_result.state not in ['SUCCESS', 'FAILURE']:
    # Wait for the task to complete
    task_result = AsyncResult(task_id)

if task_result.state == 'SUCCESS':
    # Handle successful task completion
    pass
elif task_result.state == 'FAILURE':
    # Handle task failure
    pass
```

## Example: Tracking Task Progress

Let's consider an example where we want to track the progress of a long-running task. We can use Celery's `update_state` method to update the task state and provide additional information about the progress.

```python
from celery import Task

class LongTask(Task):
    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        total = 100
        for i in range(total):
            # Perform some computation
            progress = (i + 1) / total * 100
            self.update_state(state='PROGRESS', meta={'progress': progress})
        # Task completed
        return 'Task completed successfully'
```

In the above example, we update the task state to `'PROGRESS'` and provide the progress value as metadata. This allows us to track the progress of the task as it executes.

## Conclusion

Task states play a crucial role in managing and monitoring asynchronous tasks in Celery. By enabling task tracking and using Celery's built-in mechanisms, you can easily track and handle the states of your tasks. This provides valuable insights into the progress and status of your asynchronous tasks, making it easier to build robust and scalable applications.

Now that you understand how to work with task states in Python Celery, you can leverage this feature to build more advanced task processing workflows. Happy coding!
