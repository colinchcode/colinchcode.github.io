Celery is a powerful distributed task queue framework in Python that allows you to execute tasks asynchronously across a cluster of machines. One of the key features of Celery is the ability to store and retrieve the results of tasks. By default, Celery uses a message broker (like RabbitMQ or Redis) to store task results. However, you can also configure Celery to use a different backend, such as SQLAlchemy, to store task results in a relational database.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to set up and use SQLAlchemy as a result backend in Python Celery.

## Prerequisites<a name="prerequisites"></a>

Before we proceed, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Celery (version 4.0 or higher)
- SQLAlchemy

You can install Celery and SQLAlchemy using pip:

```shell
$ pip install celery sqlalchemy
```

## Setting up SQLAlchemy<a name="setting-up-sqlalchemy"></a>

First, let's set up a SQLite database as our result backend using SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy is a popular SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that provides a set of high-level API for interacting with databases.

Create a file named `database.py` and add the following code:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Create an engine to connect to the database
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///celery_results.db')
```

## Configuring Celery<a name="configuring-celery"></a>

Next, we need to configure Celery to use SQLAlchemy as the result backend. Create a file named `celeryconfig.py` and add the following code:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

broker_url = 'your_broker_url'

# Specify the result_backend as SQLAlchemy
result_backend = 'db+sqlite:///celery_results.db'

# Set the result_expires option to control the result expiration time
result_expires = timedelta(days=1)
```

Remember to replace `your_broker_url` with the URL of your chosen message broker.

## Using SQLAlchemy as a result backend<a name="using-sqlalchemy-as-a-result-backend"></a>

Now that we have set up SQLAlchemy and configured Celery, we can start using SQLAlchemy as the result backend in our Celery tasks.

Create a file named `tasks.py` and add the following code:

```python
from celery import Celery
from database import engine

# Create a Celery instance
app = Celery('myapp', backend=engine)

# Define a Celery task
@app.task
def add(x, y):
    return x + y
```

In the above code, we import the previously created `engine` from `database.py` and pass it as the `backend` argument when creating the Celery instance. This ensures that Celery uses SQLAlchemy as the result backend.

To run the Celery worker and start processing tasks, you can use the following command:

```shell
$ celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
```

## Conclusion<a name="conclusion"></a>

In this tutorial, we set up SQLAlchemy as a result backend in Python Celery. Using SQLAlchemy allows you to store task results in a relational database, which provides flexibility and easier data querying. By configuring Celery to use SQLAlchemy, you can seamlessly integrate Celery with your existing database infrastructure.
