Python Celery is a powerful task queuing library that allows you to distribute and manage tasks across multiple workers. Along with its extensive features, Celery provides a signal system that allows you to trigger events when certain actions take place within the Celery application.

In this blog post, we will explore how to use Celery signals in Python Celery and how it can enhance the functionality and control of your Celery tasks.

## What are Celery Signals?

Celery signals provide a way to hook into different events that occur during the execution of Celery tasks. These events can be used to perform additional actions, handle errors, or send notifications. Celery provides a set of built-in signals, such as `task_success`, `task_failure`, `task_retry`, and many more.

Custom signals can also be created to handle specific events in your application or to extend the functionality of Celery.

## Adding Custom Signals

You can define custom signals in Celery using the `celery.signal` decorator. Let's see how you can define a custom signal for a specific event.

```python
from celery import signal

# Define a custom signal for a specific event
custom_signal = signal.Signal('custom_signal')
```

In the above example, we defined a `custom_signal` that can be triggered when a specific event occurs. You can also provide additional arguments to the `Signal` class constructor based on your requirements.

## Listening to Signals

To listen to Celery signals, you can use the `task_` prefix followed by the signal name as a method on your Celery task. Let's see an example of listening to signals in a Celery task.

```python
from celery import Task

# Define a Celery task
class MyTask(Task):
    def on_success(self, retval, task_id, args, kwargs):
        # Perform actions when the task succeeds
        pass

    def on_failure(self, exc, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo):
        # Perform actions when the task fails
        pass

    def on_retry(self, exc, task_id, args, kwargs, einfo):
        # Perform actions when the task is retried
        pass

```

In the above example, we define a `MyTask` class that inherits from `celery.Task`. By overriding the `on_success`, `on_failure`, and `on_retry` methods, we can perform specific actions when these events occur.

You can also listen to custom signals by using the `@task_` decorator. Let's see an example of listening to a custom signal.

```python
from celery import task

@task_task_success.connect
def handle_custom_signal(sender, **kwargs):
    # Handle the custom signal
    pass
```

In the above example, we use the `@task_task_success.connect` decorator to listen to the `task_success` signal and handle it accordingly.

## Conclusion

Celery signals provide a convenient way to hook into various events that occur during the execution of Celery tasks. Whether you want to handle task success, failure, retries, or implement custom signals for specific events, Celery signals can greatly enhance the functionality and control of your Celery application.

By leveraging the power of Celery signals, you can build robust and flexible task-based workflows that can handle complex business logic and integrate with other systems or services. So, start using Celery signals in your Python Celery application and take advantage of its powerful event-driven architecture.
