Python Celery is a powerful task queue library that allows you to distribute and run tasks asynchronously in a distributed environment. One of the key features of Celery is the ability to chain tasks together, where the output of one task becomes the input of the next task in the chain. This allows you to create complex workflows and dependencies between tasks.

In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement task chaining in Python Celery using an example scenario.

## Scenario

Let's consider a scenario where we have three tasks: `taskA`, `taskB`, and `taskC`. `taskB` depends on the output of `taskA`, and `taskC` depends on the output of `taskB`. The goal is to execute these tasks in a sequential manner, where `taskA` is executed first, followed by `taskB`, and then `taskC`.

## Setting up Celery

First, let's set up Celery. Install Celery using the following command:

```python
pip install celery
```

Create a file named `tasks.py` and add the following code:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('tasks', broker='redis://localhost:6379/0')

@app.task
def taskA():
    # Add your taskA code here
    return 'Output of taskA'

@app.task
def taskB(input):
    # Add your taskB code here, using the input from taskA
    return f'Output of taskB using input: {input}'

@app.task
def taskC(input):
    # Add your taskC code here, using the input from taskB
    return f'Output of taskC using input: {input}'
```

Make sure to replace the code placeholder with your actual task implementation code.

## Implementing Task Chaining

To chain the tasks together, we can use the `|` operator to define the dependencies. Modify the `taskA` implementation as follows:

```python
from .tasks import taskB, taskC

@app.task
def taskA():
    output_a = 'Output of taskA'
    output_b = taskB.s(output_a) | taskC.s()
    output_b()
```

Here, `taskB.s(output_a)` creates a signature for `taskB` with the output of `taskA` as the input. The `|` operator chains the tasks together, and `output_b()` executes the chain.

## Running the Celery Worker

To run the Celery worker, use the following command:

```python
celery -A tasks worker --loglevel=info
```

## Executing the Task Chaining

To execute the task chaining, add the following code at the bottom of `tasks.py` file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Execute taskA
    taskA.delay()
```

Now, when you run `python tasks.py`, the tasks will be executed in the defined order of task chaining.

## Conclusion

Task chaining in Python Celery allows you to create complex workflows and dependencies between tasks. By chaining tasks, you can ensure that the output of one task becomes the input of the next task in a sequential manner. This can greatly enhance the efficiency and organization of your codebase.

Remember to always consider the dependencies and relationships between tasks when implementing task chaining in Celery. Keep the code modular and reusable to make it easier for future modifications or additions to the task chain.

I hope this tutorial helps you understand how to implement task chaining in Python Celery. Happy coding!
