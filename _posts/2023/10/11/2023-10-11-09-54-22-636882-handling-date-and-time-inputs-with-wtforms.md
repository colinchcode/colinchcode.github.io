When building a web application with a form that requires users to input dates and times, it's essential to handle these inputs correctly. One way to accomplish this in Python is by using the WTForms library, which provides a flexible and easy-to-use solution for form handling.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to handle date and time inputs with WTForms, specifically using the `DateTimeField` and `DateField` fields.

## Prerequisites
Before we get started, make sure you have WTForms installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```python
pip install wtforms
```

## Using DateTimeField
The `DateTimeField` class in WTForms is used to handle date and time inputs. It provides validation and conversion features for managing datetime values.

Here's an example of how to use `DateTimeField` in a form:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from wtforms import Form, DateTimeField, SubmitField

class MyForm(Form):
    # Define a DateTimeField
    date_time = DateTimeField('Date and Time')
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')

# Instantiate the form
form = MyForm()

# Check if the form is submitted and valid
if form.validate_on_submit():
    # Access the date and time value
    selected_date_time = form.date_time.data
    print(selected_date_time)
```

In the above example, we create a form called `MyForm` with a `DateTimeField` named `date_time`. The `DateTimeField` takes care of rendering an appropriate input field for the user to select or enter a datetime value.

After instantiating the form, we can check if it's submitted and valid using `form.validate_on_submit()`. If the form is valid, we can access the selected *date and time* value using `form.date_time.data`.

## Using DateField
If you only need to handle dates without the time component, you can use the `DateField` class. It works in a similar way as `DateTimeField` but focuses on dates only.

Here's an example of using `DateField` in a form:

```python
from datetime import date
from wtforms import Form, DateField, SubmitField

class MyForm(Form):
    # Define a DateField
    date = DateField('Date')
    submit = SubmitField('Submit')

# Instantiate the form
form = MyForm()

# Check if the form is submitted and valid
if form.validate_on_submit():
    # Access the date value
    selected_date = form.date.data
    print(selected_date)
```

In this example, we have a form called `MyForm` with a `DateField` named `date`. The `DateField` renders a date picker input for selecting a date.

Once the form is submitted and valid, we can access the selected *date* value using `form.date.data`.

## Conclusion
Handling date and time inputs in web forms is made easy using the `DateTimeField` and `DateField` classes provided by the WTForms library. These fields handle validation, conversion, and rendering of appropriate input fields, allowing you to focus on building the rest of your application.

By following the examples shown in this blog post, you can integrate date and time inputs seamlessly into your web forms with WTForms. Happy coding!
