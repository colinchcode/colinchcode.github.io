Celery is a distributed task queue system for Python that allows you to run tasks asynchronously, managing worker processes and distributing the workload across multiple machines. Task routing in Celery refers to the process of directing tasks from specific queues to designated worker processes.

By default, Celery assigns tasks to workers based on a round-robin algorithm. However, you can customize this behavior by configuring task routing. This allows you to control which worker processes handle specific types of tasks.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to configure task routing in Python Celery.

## Understanding Celery Task Routing

Celery assigns tasks to workers based on the `queue` parameter specified when calling `@app.task` decorator. By defining different queues for different types of tasks, you can route tasks to specific worker processes.

For example, you could have a `high_priority` queue for critical tasks and a `low_priority` queue for less important tasks. By specifying which queue a task should belong to, you ensure that it is processed accordingly.

## Configuring Task Routing

To configure task routing in Celery, you need to define a `task_routes` setting in your Celery configuration file or module. This setting maps task names to the queues they should be routed to.

Here's an example configuration:

```python
# celeryconfig.py

task_routes = {
    'myapp.tasks.low_priority_task': {'queue': 'low_priority'},
    'myapp.tasks.high_priority_task': {'queue': 'high_priority'},
}
```

In this example, `low_priority_task` tasks will be routed to the `low_priority` queue, while `high_priority_task` tasks will be routed to the `high_priority` queue.

## Defining Task Queues

Before you can route tasks to specific queues, you need to define the queues themselves in your Celery configuration. This can be done using the `task_queues` setting.

Here's an example configuration:

```python
# celeryconfig.py

task_queues = (
    Queue('high_priority', Exchange('high_priority'), routing_key='high_priority'),
    Queue('low_priority', Exchange('low_priority'), routing_key='low_priority'),
)
```

In this example, we define two queues: `high_priority` and `low_priority`. Each queue is associated with an exchange and routing key that match the queue's name.

## Routing Tasks to Specific Queues

Now that you have defined task routes and queues, you need to ensure that tasks are sent to the correct queue when calling them.

You can specify the queue to be used for a specific task by passing the `queue` argument when invoking the task:

```python
from myapp.tasks import low_priority_task, high_priority_task

low_priority_task.apply_async(queue='low_priority')
high_priority_task.apply_async(queue='high_priority')
```

In this example, `low_priority_task` is assigned to the `low_priority` queue, while `high_priority_task` is assigned to the `high_priority` queue.

## Conclusion

Configuring task routing in Python Celery allows you to control the distribution of tasks to worker processes based on custom logic. By routing tasks to specific queues, you can ensure that critical tasks receive the necessary priority and are processed accordingly.

By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you should now have a good understanding of how to configure task routing in Celery and route tasks to specific queues.
