In distributed task queues, such as Celery, it is common to have a group of related tasks that need to be executed together. Celery provides a useful feature called task groups, which allows us to group multiple tasks together and manage their execution as a single unit.

## What is a task group?

A task group is a way to organize and execute related tasks in Celery. It allows you to define a set of tasks that can be executed together, and provides features to manage their execution.

## Creating a task group

To create a task group in Celery, you can use the `group` function provided by the Celery API. Here's an example of how to define a task group:

```python
from celery import group

# Define the tasks
task1 = my_task_1.s(arg1, arg2)
task2 = my_task_2.s(arg3, arg4)
task3 = my_task_3.s(arg5, arg6)

# Create the task group
group_tasks = group(task1, task2, task3)
```

In the example above, `my_task_1`, `my_task_2`, and `my_task_3` are Celery tasks that take different arguments. We create a `group_tasks` object by calling the `group` function and passing the tasks as arguments.

## Adding tasks to a group

To add more tasks to a task group, you can use the `add` method of the task group object. Here's an example:

```python
# Add more tasks to the task group
group_tasks.add(my_task_4.s(arg7, arg8))
group_tasks.add(my_task_5.s(arg9, arg10))
```

In the example above, we add two more tasks, `my_task_4` and `my_task_5`, to the existing `group_tasks` object.

## Executing a task group

To execute a task group, you can use the `apply_async` method of the task group object. This method initiates the execution of all the tasks in the group asynchronously. Here's an example:

```python
# Execute the task group
result = group_tasks.apply_async()
```

In the example above, the `apply_async` method is called on the `group_tasks` object, and the result is stored in the `result` variable. The `apply_async` method starts the execution of all the tasks in the group and returns a result object.

## Handling the result of a task group

The result object returned by the `apply_async` method can be used to track the progress and retrieve the result of the task group execution. Here's an example:

```python
# Wait for the task group to complete
result.wait()

# Get the result of each task
results = result.get()
```

In the example above, we first wait for the task group to complete using the `wait` method of the result object. Then, we can use the `get` method to retrieve the result of each task in the `results` variable.

## Conclusion

Task groups in Celery provide a convenient way to organize and execute related tasks together. By using task groups, you can easily manage the execution of complex workflows and improve the efficiency of your distributed task queue system.
