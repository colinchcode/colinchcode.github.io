Celery is a powerful distributed task queue library that allows you to run functions or methods asynchronously and in parallel. One useful feature of Celery is the ability to add callbacks to your tasks, which are functions or methods that are executed after the task completes.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement task callbacks in Celery using Python. We'll walk through the process step by step and provide example code along the way.

## Setting Up Celery

To use Celery and implement task callbacks, you'll need to have Celery installed in your Python environment. You can install Celery using pip:

```python
pip install celery
```

Once Celery is installed, you'll need to set up a celery app. Here's an example of how to set up a simple Celery app:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('myapp', broker='pyamqp://guest@localhost//', backend='rpc://')
```

Make sure to adjust the broker and backend URLs to match your setup.

## Registering a Callback Function

Before we can use task callbacks, we need to define a callback function and **register** it with Celery. The callback function will be called once the task is complete, and its signature should match the signature of the task function.

To register a callback function with Celery, use the `@app.task` decorator and pass the `on_success` or `on_failure` argument. Here's an example:

```python
@app.task(on_success=my_callback_function)
def my_task(arg1, arg2):
    # Task code here
    pass

def my_callback_function(result):
    # Callback code here
    pass
```

In the example above, `my_callback_function` will be called with the task result as its argument when `my_task` completes successfully.

## Passing Callbacks to Tasks

To actually use the registered callback function, you need to pass it as an argument when calling the task. Celery provides a `link` argument which allows you to specify one or more callbacks to be executed after the task completes.

Here's an example of how to pass a callback to a task:

```python
result = my_task.apply_async(args=[arg1, arg2], link=my_callback_function)
```

In the example above, `my_callback_function` will be called after `my_task` completes.

## Example Code

Let's now put everything together and provide an example code that demonstrates task callbacks in Celery:

```python
from celery import Celery

app = Celery('myapp', broker='pyamqp://guest@localhost//', backend='rpc://')

@app.task(on_success=my_callback_function)
def my_task(arg1, arg2):
    # Task code here
    pass

def my_callback_function(result):
    # Callback code here
    pass

result = my_task.apply_async(args=[arg1, arg2], link=my_callback_function)
```

In the example above, we define a Celery app and register `my_task` with `my_callback_function` as the callback. We then call `my_task` asynchronously and pass the required arguments and the callback function.

## Conclusion

Adding task callbacks to your Celery tasks allows you to perform additional operations or execute code after the completion of a task. This can be useful for logging, sending notifications, or triggering other tasks.

In this blog post, we've covered how to implement task callbacks in Python Celery. You've learned how to set up Celery, register a callback function, pass callbacks to tasks, and seen an example code that brings everything together.

Celery's callback feature enables you to enhance the functionality of your asynchronous tasks and handle the results effectively. Incorporating task callbacks can make your application even more robust and efficient.
