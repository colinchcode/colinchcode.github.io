When building a web application that requires user authentication, handling passwords securely is of utmost importance. Thankfully, the `WTForms` library in Python provides a convenient way to handle password fields and perform password hashing before storing them in the database. In this blog post, we will explore how to create password fields and handle password hashing with `WTForms`.

## Creating password fields

In `WTForms`, creating a password field is similar to creating a regular field, but with an additional input type. Here's an example:

```python
from wtforms import Form, PasswordField

class RegistrationForm(Form):
    username = StringField('Username')
    email = StringField('Email')
    password = PasswordField('Password')
```

In the example above, we create a `RegistrationForm` that has fields for `username`, `email`, and `password`. The `password` field is created using the `PasswordField` class and will render as a password input field in the HTML form.

## Handling password hashing

Storing passwords in plain text is a major security risk. It is important to hash passwords before storing them in the database. `WTForms` does not handle password hashing out of the box, but we can easily integrate it with a hashing library like `bcrypt`. Here's an example:

```python
from wtforms import Form, PasswordField
from bcrypt import hashpw, gensalt

class RegistrationForm(Form):
    # ...

    def hash_password(self, password):
        salt = gensalt()
        hashed_password = hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
        return hashed_password

    def validate_password(self, field):
        hashed_password = self.hash_password(field.data)
        # Add code to compare hashed_password with stored password in the database
```

In the example above, we define two methods within the `RegistrationForm` class. The `hash_password` method takes a password as input, generates a salt using `gensalt`, and hashes the password using `hashpw` from the `bcrypt` library. The `validate_password` method can be used to compare the hashed password with the stored password in the database.

Remember to set up your database schema to store the hashed password instead of the plain text password.

## Conclusion

Handling password fields securely and hashing passwords before storing them in the database is crucial for web application security. With `WTForms` and a hashing library like `bcrypt`, we can easily create password fields and handle password hashing in our Python web applications. By following these best practices, we can help ensure the privacy and security of user passwords.
