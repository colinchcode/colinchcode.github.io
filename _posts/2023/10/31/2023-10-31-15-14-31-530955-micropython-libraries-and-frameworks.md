## MicroPython <a name="micropython"></a>
MicroPython is the main tool and framework for working with MicroPython. It provides a Python interpreter that can run on microcontrollers, as well as a command-line tool for interacting with the microcontroller's file system and REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). It also comes with a comprehensive standard library, similar to the Python standard library.

MicroPython allows you to write and execute Python scripts on microcontrollers, making it easier to develop applications and projects for embedded systems. It supports a wide range of microcontroller boards, including popular ones like Arduino, ESP8266, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi Pico.
