Power management is an important aspect of any embedded system, including those running MicroPython. Efficiently managing power consumption can help extend the battery life, minimize energy usage, and increase the overall performance of your device. In this blog post, we will discuss some key concepts and techniques for power management in MicroPython.

## Low Power Modes

MicroPython provides several low power modes that allow you to reduce power consumption when the device is idle or not performing any critical tasks. These low power modes can be used to put the device into a sleep state while conserving energy.

## Sleep and Deep Sleep

Sleep and Deep Sleep are two commonly used low power modes in MicroPython. Sleep mode allows the CPU to enter a low power state while still maintaining some functionality, such as keeping the peripherals active. Deep Sleep, on the other hand, allows the CPU and peripherals to be completely powered off, resulting in even lower power consumption.

To put your device into Sleep mode, you can use the `machine.sleep()` function, and to enter Deep Sleep mode, you can use the `machine.deepsleep()` function. Both of these functions can accept an optional parameter to specify the amount of time the device should stay in the low power mode before waking up.

```python
import machine
import time

# Enter sleep mode for 5 seconds
machine.sleep(5000)

# Enter deep sleep mode for 10 seconds
machine.deepsleep(10000)
```

## Reducing CPU Frequency

Another effective way to reduce power consumption is by lowering the CPU frequency. By reducing the clock frequency of the CPU, you can decrease the amount of power consumed by the device. MicroPython provides a simple way to achieve this using the `machine.freq()` function.

```python
import machine

# Set CPU frequency to 80MHz
machine.freq(80000000)
```

## Disabling Peripherals

Disabling unnecessary peripherals when they are not in use is another power-saving technique. MicroPython provides a `machine.deinit()` function that can be used to disable peripherals such as UART, I2C, SPI, etc. This can significantly reduce power consumption.

Here's an example of how to disable the UART peripheral:

```python
import machine

# Disable UART
uart = machine.UART(0)
uart.deinit()
```

## Wakeup Sources

MicroPython allows you to set up various wakeup sources to interrupt the low power modes and wake up the device. Wakeup sources can include GPIO pins, timers, and external interrupts.

To set up a wakeup source, you can use the `machine.Pin` class to configure a GPIO pin as an input with wakeup capabilities. You can then use the `machine.lightsleep()` function to put the device into a low power mode that can be interrupted by the configured wakeup source.

```python
import machine

# Configure GPIO pin as wakeup source
button_pin = machine.Pin(12, machine.Pin.IN, machine.Pin.PULL_UP)
button_pin.irq(trigger=machine.Pin.IRQ_RISING, wake=machine.DEEPSLEEP)

# Enter light sleep mode
machine.lightsleep()
```

## Battery Monitoring

To efficiently manage power consumption, it's important to monitor the battery voltage. MicroPython provides a built-in ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) module that can be used to measure the battery voltage and detect low-power conditions.

```python
import machine

# Configure ADC pin for battery voltage measurement
adc = machine.ADC(machine.Pin(36))
adc.atten(machine.ADC.ATTN_11DB)

# Read the battery voltage
battery_voltage = adc.read() / 4095 * 3.7  # Assuming 12-bit ADC with 3.7V reference voltage
```

By monitoring the battery voltage, you can take appropriate actions when it falls below a certain threshold, such as entering a low power mode or sending a notification.

## Conclusion

Efficient power management is crucial for optimizing the performance and battery life of embedded systems running MicroPython. By leveraging the low power modes, reducing CPU frequency, disabling peripherals, setting up wakeup sources, and monitoring the battery voltage, you can achieve significant power savings.
