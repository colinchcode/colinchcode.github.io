MicroPython is a lightweight implementation of the Python programming language that is optimized for microcontrollers and embedded systems. It provides an easy and efficient way to program these devices, making them more accessible to beginners and professionals alike.

In this article, we will take a look at some of the popular MicroPython boards and devices available in the market.

## 1. [Pyboard](#pyboard)
## 2. [ESP8266 and ESP32](#esp)
## 3. [Adafruit CircuitPython Boards](#adafruit)

## Pyboard {#pyboard}

The Pyboard is the official MicroPython board developed by the creator of MicroPython, Damien George. It is designed to be small and compact, yet powerful enough to handle a wide range of projects. The Pyboard features a fast 168MHz Cortex M4 processor, 192KB of RAM, and 1MB of flash memory. It also includes a microSD card slot, USB connectivity, and an accelerometer sensor.

The Pyboard is great for beginners as well as advanced users who want to develop projects with advanced features.

## ESP8266 and ESP32 {#esp}

The ESP8266 and ESP32 are popular Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-enabled microcontrollers that can run MicroPython firmware. These devices are widely used for IoT projects due to their low cost, low power consumption, and built-in wireless capabilities.

The ESP8266 is the older version and is based on a 32-bit Tensilica Xtensa LX106 processor. It has 80KB of RAM and 4MB of flash memory. The ESP32, on the other hand, is more powerful, with a dual-core 240MHz Xtensa LX6 processor, 520KB of RAM, and up to 16MB of flash memory.

Both the ESP8266 and ESP32 are highly versatile and can be used in various projects, including home automation, sensor monitoring, and remote control applications.

## Adafruit CircuitPython Boards {#adafruit}

Adafruit is a well-known name in the maker community, and they have developed a range of MicroPython-compatible boards known as CircuitPython boards. These boards are designed to be beginner-friendly and come with many built-in features, making them suitable for various projects.

Some popular CircuitPython boards from Adafruit include the Feather boards, Metro boards, and ItsyBitsy boards. These boards come with different microcontrollers, such as the ATSAMD21, ATSAMD51, and ESP32-S2, providing a range of options to suit different project requirements.

Adafruit CircuitPython boards are known for their excellent documentation and community support, making them a great choice for beginners who want to learn and experiment with MicroPython.

## Conclusion

MicroPython has revolutionized the way we program microcontrollers and embedded systems. With a wide range of MicroPython boards and devices available, developers and makers have more options to choose from based on their needs and project requirements.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, MicroPython provides an easy-to-use and powerful platform to build exciting projects. So go ahead and explore the world of MicroPython with these amazing boards and devices!
