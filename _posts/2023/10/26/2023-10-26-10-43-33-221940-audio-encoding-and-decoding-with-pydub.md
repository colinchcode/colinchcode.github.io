## Introduction to Pydub
Pydub provides a simple API for performing various audio operations, including encoding and decoding. It is based on the FFmpeg libraries, making it capable of handling a wide range of audio formats.

To get started, you will need to install Pydub by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pydub
```

Once installed, you can import the library in your Python script:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
```

## Audio Encoding
Encoding audio involves converting it from one format to another. Pydub makes it easy to encode audio files by providing a `export` method. Here's an example of encoding an audio file from WAV to MP3 format:

```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_wav('input.wav')
audio.export('output.mp3', format='mp3')
```

In the above code snippet, `from_wav` method reads the WAV file and `export` method is used to save it in MP3 format. You can replace `input.wav` and `output.mp3` with the actual file paths.

Pydub supports a wide range of audio formats for encoding, such as MP3, WAV, AAC, OGG, and more. You can specify the desired format by setting the `format` parameter in the `export` method.

## Audio Decoding
Decoding audio involves converting it from one format back to its raw data. Pydub allows you to decode audio files using the `from_file` method. Here's an example of decoding an MP3 file to WAV format:

```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_file('input.mp3', format='mp3')
audio.export('output.wav', format='wav')
```

In the above code snippet, `from_file` method reads the MP3 file and `export` method is used to save it in WAV format. You can replace `input.mp3` and `output.wav` with the actual file paths.

Similar to audio encoding, Pydub supports various audio formats for decoding. You can specify the input format using the `format` parameter in the `from_file` method.

## Conclusion
Pydub is a powerful and user-friendly library for encoding and decoding audio files. Its simplicity and extensive format support make it a popular choice for audio processing tasks in Python. By using Pydub, you can easily convert audio files between different formats with just a few lines of code.

In this blog post, we explored how to encode and decode audio files using Pydub. We saw examples of converting audio from WAV to MP3 format and vice versa. As you dive deeper into the library, you will discover more advanced features and capabilities.
