In this blog post, we will learn how to load audio files using Pydub, a powerful audio processing library for Python. Pydub makes it easy to work with audio files, allowing us to load, manipulate, and save audio in various formats.

To get started, make sure you have Pydub installed. If not, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pydub
```

Now let's dive into loading audio files with Pydub.

## Loading a single audio file

To load a single audio file, we can use the `AudioSegment` class from Pydub. Here's how to do it:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load an audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("path/to/audio/file.mp3")
```

In the above code, replace `"path/to/audio/file.mp3"` with the actual path to your audio file. Pydub supports various audio formats, such as MP3, WAV, FLAC, and more.

## Loading multiple audio files

Pydub also provides a convenient way to load multiple audio files and concatenate them into a single audio segment. Here's an example:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load multiple audio files
audio1 = AudioSegment.from_file("path/to/file1.mp3")
audio2 = AudioSegment.from_file("path/to/file2.mp3")
audio3 = AudioSegment.from_file("path/to/file3.mp3")

# Concatenate them
combined_audio = audio1 + audio2 + audio3
```

You can replace `"path/to/file1.mp3"`, `"path/to/file2.mp3"`, and `"path/to/file3.mp3"` with the actual paths to your audio files.

## Conclusion

Loading audio files with Pydub is straightforward and allows us to easily work with audio in our Python projects. We can load both single and multiple audio files, perform various operations on them, and save them in different formats.

Pydub's documentation provides more information on the many capabilities of the library. You can find it [here](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub).

Happy audio processing!
