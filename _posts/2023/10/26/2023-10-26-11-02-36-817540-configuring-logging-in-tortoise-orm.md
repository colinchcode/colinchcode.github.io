When using Tortoise ORM for your Python projects, it's often helpful to configure logging to keep track of any errors, warnings, or other information generated by the ORM. By properly configuring logging, you can easily monitor and debug your application.

In this blog post, we will guide you through the process of configuring logging in Tortoise ORM to enhance your development experience.

## Introduction

Logging is a built-in module in Python that provides a flexible way to record events and messages. Tortoise ORM internally uses the Python logging module, so we can leverage its power to configure our logging preferences easily.

## Enabling Logging

First, let's start by importing the `logging` module and enabling logging in Tortoise ORM. We need to call the `Tortoise.init` method with the `log_sql=True` parameter to enable SQL logging:

```python
import logging
import tortoise

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
tortoise.Tortoise.init(..., log_sql=True)
```

## Setting the Logging Level

The logging module provides several levels of logging, such as `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL`. You can set the desired logging level using the `logging.basicConfig` method. For example, if you want to set the logging level to `DEBUG`, use the following code:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

By default, Tortoise ORM logs at the `INFO` level, which includes all SQL queries and some additional information. However, you can change it to a different level based on your needs.

## Customizing Log Format

The logging module allows customizing the log format to display the desired information. You can use the `format` parameter of the `basicConfig` method to specify a custom log format.

Here's an example of setting a custom log format to include the timestamp, log level, and message:

```python
logging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)
```

Feel free to customize the log format according to your preferences.

## Redirecting Logs to a File

By default, Tortoise ORM logs to the console. However, you can redirect the logs to a file by specifying the `filename` parameter in the `basicConfig` method. This will create a log file and write all logs to it.

```python
logging.basicConfig(filename='tortoise.log', level=logging.INFO)
```

Make sure to provide a valid file name and path for the log file.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to configure logging in Tortoise ORM. By enabling logging, setting the logging level, customizing the log format, and redirecting logs to a file, you can effectively monitor and debug your application. The logging module provides flexibility and powerful features to enhance your development experience with Tortoise ORM.
