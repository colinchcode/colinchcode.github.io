When building web applications with Flask, it's common to use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool like SQLAlchemy to interact with databases. SQLAlchemy allows us to perform database operations using Python code, making it easier to manage and update data.

In this article, we will focus on updating records in the database using SQLAlchemy in Flask. Let's get started!

## Setup

Before we begin, make sure you have Flask and SQLAlchemy installed in your project. You can install them using pip:

```python
pip install Flask
pip install SQLAlchemy
```

## Connecting to the Database

To connect to the database, we need to define a SQLAlchemy `db` object. This is typically done in your Flask application's `app.py` file:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'your_database_url'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

Replace `'your_database_url'` with the actual connection URL for your database.

## Updating Records

To update records in the database, we need to follow these steps:

1. Access the record(s) we want to update.
2. Modify the desired fields.
3. Commit the changes to the database.

Let's assume we have a `User` model that represents users in our application. We want to update the email address of a specific user. Here's an example of how to update a user's email using SQLAlchemy:

```python
from models import User

user_to_update = User.query.get(user_id)
user_to_update.email = 'new_email@example.com'
db.session.commit()
```

In the code above, `User` is the SQLAlchemy model representing the `users` table in the database. We query the user we want to update using `User.query.get(user_id)`, where `user_id` is the ID of the user we want to update. Then, we assign the new email address to the `email` attribute of the user object. Finally, we call `db.session.commit()` to save the changes to the database.

You can also update multiple records at once using SQLAlchemy's `update` method:

```python
from models import User

User.query.filter_by(status='inactive').update({'status': 'active'})
db.session.commit()
```

In this example, we update the `status` field of all users with a status of 'inactive' to 'active'.

## Conclusion

Updating records in the database using SQLAlchemy in Flask is straightforward. We access the record(s) we want to update, modify the desired fields, and commit the changes to the database. SQLAlchemy simplifies the process by allowing us to work with databases using Python code.

Happy coding!
