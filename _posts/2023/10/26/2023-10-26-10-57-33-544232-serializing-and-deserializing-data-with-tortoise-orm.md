Tortoise ORM is an asynchronous Python ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library that provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with databases using Python. Apart from the usual database operations, Tortoise ORM also supports serializing and deserializing data, allowing you to easily convert your data between different formats such as JSON or XML.

In this blog post, we will explore how to serialize and deserialize data with Tortoise ORM using Python.

## Serializing Data

Serialization is the process of converting structured data (such as objects, dictionaries, or lists) into a format that can be stored or transmitted, and later reconstructed into its original form. Tortoise ORM provides a straightforward way to serialize data based on your model's structure.

### Basic Serialization

To serialize data with Tortoise ORM, you can use the `to_dict` method provided by the model instance. Let's consider a simple Example model representing a user:

```python
class User(models.Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    username = fields.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = fields.CharField(max_length=100)
    age = fields.IntField()
```

To serialize a User instance to a dictionary, you can call the `to_dict()` method:

```python
user = await User.get(id=1)
user_data = user.to_dict()
```

The `to_dict()` method will return a dictionary representation of the User instance, which can then be easily serialized into a JSON or XML format using the appropriate libraries.

### Custom Serialization

In some cases, you may want to customize the serialization process by including or excluding certain fields or applying custom formatting. Tortoise ORM allows you to define a custom serialization method for your models by overriding the `to_dict()` method.

Let's say we want to include only the `username` and `email` fields in our serialized data. We can define a custom `to_dict()` method in our User model:

```python
class User(models.Model):
    # fields definition ...

    def to_dict(self) -> dict:
        return {
            'username': self.username,
            'email': self.email,
        }
```

With this custom `to_dict()` method, only the username and email fields will be included in the serialized data.

## Deserializing Data

Deserialization is the reverse process of serialization, where the serialized data is converted back into its original form. Tortoise ORM provides methods to reconstruct model instances from serialized data.

### Basic Deserialization

To deserialize data with Tortoise ORM, you can use the `from_dict` class method provided by the model. This method allows you to create a model instance from a dictionary.

Let's use the User model from the previous example:

```python
user_data = {'username': 'john_doe', 'email': 'test@example.com'}
user = await User.from_dict(user_data)
```

The `from_dict()` method will create a new User instance with the field values from the dictionary.

### Custom Deserialization

Similar to serialization, you can also define a custom deserialization method for your models in Tortoise ORM. This can be useful when you want to handle additional logic during the deserialization process.

You can override the `from_dict()` method in the model to implement custom deserialization:

```python
class User(models.Model):
    # fields definition ...

    @classmethod
    def from_dict(cls, obj: dict):
        # Custom logic for deserialization
        username = obj.get('username', '')
        email = obj.get('email', '')
        user = cls(username=username, email=email)
        return user
```

In this example, the custom `from_dict()` method allows us to handle additional logic while creating a User instance from the dictionary.

## Conclusion

Serialization and deserialization are essential processes when dealing with data storage and transmission. With Tortoise ORM, you can easily convert your model instances to different formats and reconstruct them back from serialized data.

In this blog post, we explored the basics of serialization and deserialization with Tortoise ORM. We covered methods for basic serialization and deserialization, as well as how to customize the process to fit your specific requirements.

Tortoise ORM provides a convenient way to handle data serialization and deserialization, making it easier to work with different data formats and integrate with other systems.
