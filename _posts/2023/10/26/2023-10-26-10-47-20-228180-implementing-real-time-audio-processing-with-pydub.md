Pydub is a powerful audio processing library for Python that allows you to easily manipulate audio files. In addition to its file handling capabilities, Pydub also supports real-time audio processing, which is useful for tasks such as live audio streaming or processing audio from a microphone.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of implementing real-time audio processing using Pydub. We will start by installing Pydub and its dependencies, then we will write a basic script to capture audio from a microphone and perform some processing on it.

## 1. Installing Pydub

Before we can start using Pydub, we need to install it along with its dependencies. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```shell
pip install pydub
```

This will install Pydub and its required dependencies.

## 2. Capturing Audio

To capture audio from a microphone, we will use the `sounddevice` library. Start by installing it by running the following command:

```shell
pip install sounddevice
```

Next, let's write a simple script to capture audio from the microphone:

```python
import sounddevice as sd

def audio_callback(indata, frames, time, status):
    # Process the audio data here
    pass

# Set the sample rate and duration
sample_rate = 44100
duration = 5  # 5 seconds

# Start capturing audio
with sd.InputStream(callback=audio_callback, channels=1, samplerate=sample_rate):
    sd.sleep(int(duration * 1000))
```

In the code above, we define an `audio_callback` function that will be called for each audio buffer received from the microphone. Inside this function, you can process the audio data as needed.

We then set the desired sample rate and duration for capturing audio. In this example, we set the sample rate to 44100 Hz and the duration to 5 seconds. Modify these values according to your requirements.

Finally, we create an `InputStream` object from `sounddevice` and pass our `audio_callback` function as the `callback` argument. We also specify the number of channels (1 for mono) and the sample rate. We then use `sd.sleep` to wait for the desired duration before stopping the audio capture.

## 3. Processing Audio

With the audio capture in place, let's now look at an example of how to process the captured audio using Pydub. In this example, we will simply print the peak dBFS (decibels relative to full scale) value of each captured audio buffer:

```python
import sounddevice as sd
from pydub import AudioSegment

def audio_callback(indata, frames, time, status):
    # Convert the audio buffer to Pydub's AudioSegment format
    audio_segment = AudioSegment(
        indata.tobytes(),
        frame_rate=sample_rate,
        sample_width=indata.dtype.itemsize,
        channels=1
    )

    # Print the peak dBFS value
    print("Peak dBFS:", audio_segment.dBFS)

# Set the sample rate and duration
sample_rate = 44100
duration = 5  # 5 seconds

# Start capturing audio
with sd.InputStream(callback=audio_callback, channels=1, samplerate=sample_rate):
    sd.sleep(int(duration * 1000))
```

In the `audio_callback` function, we convert the raw audio buffer received from the microphone to Pydub's `AudioSegment` format. We pass the buffer data, sample rate, sample width, and number of channels to the `AudioSegment` constructor.

We then access the `dBFS` property of the `AudioSegment` object to get the peak dBFS value of the audio buffer. This value represents the loudness of the audio relative to the maximum possible loudness. In this example, we simply print the peak dBFS value, but you can perform any additional processing as needed.

## 4. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have seen how to implement real-time audio processing using Pydub. We started by installing Pydub and its dependencies, then we wrote a script to capture audio from a microphone and perform some basic processing on it.

With the foundations laid out, you can now explore more advanced audio processing techniques with Pydub, such as applying filters, adjusting volume levels, or even performing real-time audio synthesis. Refer to the official Pydub documentation for more information and examples.

Happy coding!
