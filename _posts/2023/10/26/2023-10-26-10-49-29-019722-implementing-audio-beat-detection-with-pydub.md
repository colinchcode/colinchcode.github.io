Beat detection is a popular technique used in music processing to identify the rhythmic pattern or "beat" in a song. With Pydub, a powerful audio processing library for Python, we can easily implement beat detection functionality in our code.

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of loading an audio file, applying beat detection, and visualizing the results. Let's get started!

## Installing Pydub

Before we begin, make sure you have Pydub installed. You can install it via `pip` using the following command:

```shell
pip install pydub
```

## Loading Audio File

Let's start by importing the necessary libraries and loading an audio file:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load audio file
audio_file = AudioSegment.from_file("path/to/audio.wav")
```

Replace `"path/to/audio.wav"` with the actual path to your audio file.

## Beat Detection

To perform beat detection, we will use the `beat_detection` function provided by Pydub. This function analyzes the audio and returns a list of timestamps where beats are detected:

```python
from pydub.utils import mediainfo
from pydub.playback import play
from pydub.utils import make_chunks
from pydub.sync import detect_bpm
from pydub.utils import get_array_type

def detect_beats(audio_file):
    # Convert audio to mono (if stereo)
    if audio_file.channels > 1:
        audio_file = audio_file.set_channels(1)

    # Convert audio to 16-bit raw PCM (if not already)
    if audio_file.sample_width != 2:
        audio_file = audio_file.set_sample_width(2)

    # Convert audio to a numpy array
    audio_array = audio_file.get_array_of_samples()
    audio_array = audio_array.astype(get_array_type(audio_file.sample_width * 8))

    # Perform beat detection
    bpm, beats = detect_bpm(audio_file)

    # Calculate beat timestamps
    beat_timestamps = [beat * 1000 for beat in beats]

    return beat_timestamps
```

The `detect_beats` function accepts an audio file and returns a list of beat timestamps in milliseconds.

## Visualizing Results

Now that we have our beat timestamps, we can visualize them by plotting them on a timeline. Let's use Matplotlib for this:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def visualize_beats(beat_timestamps):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
    plt.plot(beat_timestamps, [1] * len(beat_timestamps), 'ro')

    plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
    plt.ylabel('Beat')
    plt.title('Beat Detection')
    plt.xlim(0, max(beat_timestamps) + 1000)

    plt.show()
```

The `visualize_beats` function takes the beat timestamps as input and plots them on a timeline.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the basics of implementing audio beat detection using Pydub. We loaded an audio file, applied beat detection, and visualized the results using Matplotlib. You can now use this knowledge to build more advanced applications involving audio processing.

Pydub provides various other functionalities for audio processing, so make sure to explore its documentation for more advanced usage.

Happy coding!
