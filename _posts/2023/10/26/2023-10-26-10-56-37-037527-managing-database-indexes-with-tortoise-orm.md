When it comes to optimizing database performance, one important factor to consider is the effective use of database indexes. Indexes can significantly improve query performance by allowing the database to quickly locate the desired data.

In this blog post, we will explore how to manage database indexes using Tortoise ORM, a Python asyncio ORM inspired by Django ORM. Tortoise ORM provides a convenient way to define and work with indexes in your database schema.

## What is a database index?

A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It is created on one or more columns of a table, which allows for faster searching and sorting of the data.

## Defining indexes with Tortoise ORM

Tortoise ORM allows you to define indexes at the field level by using the `indexes` attribute in the field definition. Here's an example:

```python
from tortoise import fields, models

class User(models.Model):
    name = fields.CharField(max_length=100, indexes=True)
    email = fields.CharField(max_length=100, indexes=["unique"])
    age = fields.IntField()
```

In the above example, the `name` field is indexed, meaning that queries using this field will be faster. The `email` field is also indexed with the `"unique"` option, ensuring that the values in this field are unique.

## Customizing index options

Tortoise ORM allows you to customize the options for the indexes. Here are a few examples:

- `indexes=True`: Create a regular index.
- `indexes=["unique"]`: Create a unique index.
- `indexes=["index_name"]`: Create an index with a specific name.
- `indexes=["index_name", "unique"]`: Create a unique index with a specific name.

## Generating database indexes

Once you have defined the indexes in your model, you can use Tortoise ORM's `generate_schemas` function to generate the database indexes:

```python
from tortoise import Tortoise, run_async

async def generate_schema():
    await Tortoise.init(db_url="postgres://user:password@localhost/mydatabase")
    await Tortoise.generate_schemas()

run_async(generate_schema())
```

This will create the necessary indexes in the specified database.

## Conclusion

Managing database indexes is crucial for optimizing query performance. Tortoise ORM provides a convenient way to define and manage indexes in your database schema. By properly utilizing indexes, you can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of your database queries.
