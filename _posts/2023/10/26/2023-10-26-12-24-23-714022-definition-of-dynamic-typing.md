In Python, you can assign different types of values to a variable during the execution of a program. For example, you can assign an integer to a variable, and later change it to hold a string value. The interpreter will automatically adjust the type of the variable as needed.

```python
# Example of dynamic typing in Python

# Asigning an integer to the variable
x = 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

# Changing the value to a string
x = "Hello, World!"
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'str'>
```

In the above code snippet, the variable `x` initially holds an integer value, and its type is determined as `int`. Later, the value of `x` is changed to a string, and the type of `x` is updated to `str`.

Dynamic typing provides flexibility to the programmer, as it allows for easier and more natural expression of ideas. It also allows for faster development and prototyping, as there is no need to specify types explicitly. However, it can also introduce potential errors if not used carefully, as the type of a variable can change unexpectedly during the execution of a program.

Overall, dynamic typing in Python enables a more fluid and dynamic programming experience, making the language popular among developers for its ease of use and expressiveness.
