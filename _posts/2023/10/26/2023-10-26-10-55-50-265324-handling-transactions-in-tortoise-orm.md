Tortoise ORM is a popular object-relational mapping library for Python. It provides an easy and intuitive way to interact with databases using Python objects. In this article, we will explore how to handle transactions in Tortoise ORM.

### What are transactions?

Transactions are a way to ensure the integrity and consistency of data in a database. A transaction represents a sequence of database operations that are performed as a single unit. Either all of the operations in the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are. This ensures that the database remains consistent even in the presence of errors or failures.

### Creating a transaction

To create a transaction in Tortoise ORM, we can make use of the `atomic` context manager. The `atomic` context manager ensures that all the database operations inside it are part of a single transaction. If any of the operations fail, the entire transaction is rolled back.

Here's an example:

```python
from tortoise import Tortoise, fields, run_async
from tortoise.models import Model

class User(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    name = fields.CharField(max_length=255)

async def create_user(name):
    async with Tortoise.open_db('sqlite://:memory:') as conn:
        await conn.execute_script('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);')
        
        async with conn.start_transaction():
            user = await User.create(name=name)
        
            # Do other database operations
            
        # Transaction is automatically committed at the end of the context manager

run_async(create_user("John Doe"))
```

In the example above, we first create a `User` model using Tortoise ORM. Inside the `create_user` function, we open a database connection and create the necessary table if it doesn't exist already.

We then start a transaction using the `start_transaction` method on the database connection. All the database operations inside this context manager are a part of the transaction. In this case, we create a new user.

After the context manager ends, Tortoise ORM automatically commits the transaction. If an exception occurs inside the context manager, the transaction is rolled back.

### Error handling within a transaction

If you encounter an error within a transaction, you can handle it as you would with any other Python code. You can catch the exception and take appropriate action, such as rolling back the transaction or handling the error in some other way.

```python
async with conn.start_transaction():
    try:
        # Do some operations
    except Exception as e:
        await conn.rollback()
        # Handle the error
```

In the example above, we enclose the database operations inside a `try` block. If an exception occurs, we call the `rollback` method on the database connection to rollback the transaction. We then handle the error in the `except` block.

### Conclusion

Handling transactions in Tortoise ORM is straightforward with the `atomic` context manager. By enclosing your database operations inside a transaction, you ensure data integrity and consistency. Remember to handle errors appropriately and rollback the transaction if necessary.
