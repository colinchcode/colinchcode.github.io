When working with large datasets, it is often necessary to limit the number of records returned from a database query or to retrieve records in chunks. Tortoise ORM, an easy-to-use Python ORM library, provides methods to achieve this.

### Limiting Query Results

To limit the number of results returned by a query in Tortoise ORM, you can use the `limit` method. This method allows you to specify the maximum number of records to be retrieved.

Consider the following example:

```python
# import necessary modules
from tortoise import Tortoise, fields, run_async
from tortoise.models import Model

# Define a model
class User(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    name = fields.CharField(max_length=255)

# Initialize the ORM
Tortoise.init_models(["__main__"])

# Define an asynchronous function to query the database
async def get_users(limit: int):
    users = await User.all().limit(limit)
    return users

# Run the query asynchronously
users = run_async(get_users(10))
```

In the above code, the `limit` method is used to specify that only 10 records should be returned from the `User` model. However, you can change the value of the `limit` parameter to retrieve a different number of records.

### Offsetting Query Results

In addition to limiting the results, you may also need to retrieve records starting from a specific position. This is where the `offset` method comes in handy. The `offset` method allows you to skip a specified number of records before starting to retrieve the subsequent records.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of `offset`:

```python
# import necessary modules
from tortoise import Tortoise, fields, run_async
from tortoise.models import Model

# Define a model
class User(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    name = fields.CharField(max_length=255)

# Initialize the ORM
Tortoise.init_models(["__main__"])

# Define an asynchronous function to query the database
async def get_users(offset: int, limit: int):
    users = await User.all().offset(offset).limit(limit)
    return users

# Run the query asynchronously
users = run_async(get_users(10, 5))
```

In the above code, the `offset` method is used to skip the first 10 records before retrieving the subsequent 5 records. You can change the values of the `offset` and `limit` parameters to suit your needs.

### Conclusion

Tortoise ORM provides a convenient and intuitive way to limit and offset query results. By utilizing the `limit` and `offset` methods, you can control the number of records returned and retrieve records in chunks, which can be crucial when dealing with large datasets.
