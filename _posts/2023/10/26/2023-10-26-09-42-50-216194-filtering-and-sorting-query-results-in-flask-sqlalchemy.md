When working with databases in Flask applications, the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension provides a powerful and easy-to-use interface. In this blog post, we'll explore how to filter and sort query results using Flask-SQLAlchemy.

### Filtering Query Results

Filtering query results allows us to retrieve only the data that meets specific criteria. Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a variety of methods to perform filtering, such as `filter_by`, `filter`, `like`, `ilike`, `in_`, and many more.

To demonstrate this, let's assume we have a `User` model with attributes like `id`, `name`, and `age`. We want to retrieve all users who are 25 years old. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///example.db'
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50))
    age = db.Column(db.Integer)

# Filtering query results
users = User.query.filter(User.age == 25).all()
```

In the above code, we use the `filter` method to specify the condition for the filtering. Here, we filter the users based on their age being equal to 25. The `all` method retrieves all the matching records.

### Sorting Query Results

Sorting query results allows us to arrange the data in a specific order. Flask-SQLAlchemy provides the `order_by` method to sort query results based on one or more attributes. By default, sorting is done in ascending order. We can also use the `desc` method to sort in descending order.

To demonstrate this, let's extend the previous example and sort the users by their name in ascending order:

```python
# Sorting query results
users = User.query.order_by(User.name).all()
```

In the above code, we use the `order_by` method to sort the query results based on the `name` attribute. The `all` method retrieves all the records in the sorted order.

### Filtering and Sorting Combined

In many cases, we may need to filter and sort the query results at the same time. Flask-SQLAlchemy allows us to chain the `filter` and `order_by` methods together to achieve this.

Here's an example of filtering users aged 25 or above and sorting them by name in ascending order:

```python
# Filtering and sorting query results
users = User.query.filter(User.age >= 25).order_by(User.name).all()
```

In the above code, we use the `filter` method to specify the condition for filtering. We then chain the `order_by` method to sort the results based on the `name` attribute.

### Conclusion

Filtering and sorting query results are powerful features provided by Flask-SQLAlchemy. By using the `filter` and `order_by` methods, we can easily retrieve specific data from the database based on our requirements.
