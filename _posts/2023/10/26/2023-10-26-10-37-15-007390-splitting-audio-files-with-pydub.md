## Introduction to Pydub <a name="introduction-to-pydub"></a>

Pydub is a simple and easy-to-use audio processing library for Python. It provides a high-level API for manipulating and working with audio files. With Pydub, you can perform various operations such as splitting, merging, converting formats, and applying effects to audio files.

## Installing Pydub <a name="installing-pydub"></a>

Before we begin, make sure you have Pydub installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pydub
```

## Splitting Audio Files <a name="splitting-audio-files"></a>

To split an audio file with Pydub, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:
```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
```

2. Load the audio file:
```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("input.mp3")
```

3. Define the start and end times for the segment you want to extract:
```python
start_time = 10000  # in milliseconds
end_time = 20000  # in milliseconds
```

4. Extract the segment from the original audio:
```python
segment = audio[start_time:end_time]
```

5. Export the extracted segment to a new audio file:
```python
segment.export("output.mp3", format="mp3")
```

That's it! You have successfully split an audio file using Pydub.
