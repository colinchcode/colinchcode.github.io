Static typing in Python involves declaring variable types at the time of code writing and checking them during compile-time or using a type checker. While Python is a dynamically-typed language by default, there are certain libraries and frameworks that allow you to incorporate static typing into your Python projects.

In this article, we will explore some popular Python libraries and frameworks that rely on static typing, enabling you to write more robust and maintainable code.

## What is static typing? 

Static typing is the practice of declaring and enforcing types in a programming language. Instead of allowing variables to have any type at runtime, static typing requires you to declare the types upfront, which are then checked at compile-time or by using a type checker.

## Benefits of static typing

Using static typing in your Python projects can provide several benefits:

- **Improved code quality**: Static typing helps catch type-related errors during compilation, reducing the chances of runtime errors.
- **Enhanced code readability**: Explicitly stating the types of variables and function parameters makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the codebase.
- **Better IDE support**: Static typing allows IDEs to provide more accurate code suggestions, autocompletion, and documentation.

## Popular Python libraries and frameworks for static typing

### mypy

[mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) is one of the most popular static type checkers for Python. It is an optional static type checker that can catch common programming errors and provide better tooling support.

With mypy, you can annotate your Python code with type hints and then use the mypy command-line tool to check for any type errors. It integrates well with popular code editors and IDEs, providing real-time feedback on type correctness.

### Pyright

[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is a fast type checker for Python created by Microsoft. It offers type checking, code completion, and other smart features.

Pyright is built using the TypeScript and JavaScript language services framework, making it highly efficient and scalable. It supports type hinting and static analysis, allowing you to catch errors early in the development process.

### Pydantic

[Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) is a data validation and parsing library for Python. It combines the benefits of runtime checking and static typing, making it easier to define and validate data models.

Pydantic allows you to define data schemas using Python classes and type annotations. It can automatically validate input data, sanitize values, and provide meaningful error messages. It integrates well with other libraries like FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.

### Django

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a popular Python web framework that also supports static typing. Starting from version 3.0, Django leverages type hints to improve code quality and developer experience.

By using static typing with Django, you can catch errors early, benefit from improved IDE support, and write more self-documenting code. Django's static typing annotations cover various aspects such as models, views, forms, and database queries.

### FastAPI

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. It relies heavily on static typing to provide strong API validation and automatic documentation generation.

By utilizing static typing annotations, FastAPI can automatically validate and convert incoming request data and generate interactive API documentation. It integrates well with Pydantic for data validation and other related tasks.

## Conclusion

Static typing is an effective technique that can bring significant benefits to your Python projects. Libraries and frameworks like mypy, Pyright, Pydantic, Django, and FastAPI enable you to introduce static typing and enhance your codebase's robustness and maintainability.

By incorporating static typing, you can catch type-related errors early, improve code readability, and take advantage of better IDE support. Experiment with these libraries and frameworks to leverage the power of static typing in your Python development workflow.
