When working with databases in Flask, SQLAlchemy is a powerful tool that provides an intuitive and flexible way to interact with the database. In this article, we will explore some advanced querying techniques using SQLAlchemy in Flask.

## Connecting to the Database

To get started, we need to establish a connection to the database using SQLAlchemy. First, we need to import the necessary modules:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
```

We then create an instance of the Flask application and configure the database URL:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db'
```

Next, we initialize the SQLAlchemy extension and bind it to the Flask application:

```python
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```

Now that we are connected to the database, we can start querying.

## Basic Querying

Before we dive into the advanced techniques, let's start with some basic querying using SQLAlchemy. Suppose we have a `User` model with the following structure:

```python
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50))
    email = db.Column(db.String(100))
```

To retrieve all users from the database, we can use the following query:

```python
users = User.query.all()
```

To filter the results based on a specific condition, we can use the `filter` method:

```python
users = User.query.filter(User.name == 'John').all()
```

## Advanced Querying

### Filtering with Multiple Conditions

Sometimes, we need to filter records based on multiple conditions. SQLAlchemy provides the `and_` and `or_` methods to combine multiple conditions:

```python
users = User.query.filter(db.and_(User.name == 'John', User.email == 'john@example.com')).all()
```

### Sorting

To sort the results in ascending or descending order, we can use the `order_by` method:

```python
users = User.query.order_by(User.name.asc()).all()  # Ascending order
users = User.query.order_by(User.name.desc()).all()  # Descending order
```

### Pagination

When dealing with a large number of records, it's common to implement pagination. SQLAlchemy provides the `paginate` method to achieve this:

```python
page_num = 1
page_size = 10

pagination = User.query.paginate(page=page_num, per_page=page_size)
users = pagination.items
total_pages = pagination.pages
```

### Aggregation

To perform aggregation operations like counting or summing, SQLAlchemy provides various functions such as `count`, `sum`, and `avg`:

```python
from sqlalchemy import func

total_users = db.session.query(func.count(User.id)).scalar()
average_age = db.session.query(func.avg(User.age)).scalar()
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored some advanced querying techniques using SQLAlchemy in Flask. We learned how to connect to the database, perform basic and advanced queries, and use sorting, pagination, and aggregation operations. SQLAlchemy provides numerous features and functions to make database querying a breeze in Flask applications.
