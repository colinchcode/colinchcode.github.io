Access control and permission management are critical aspects of any application that requires user authentication. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement access control and permissions using Tortoise ORM, a powerful Python library for working with databases.

## Introduction to Access Control and Permissions {#introduction}

Access control ensures that only authorized users can perform certain actions within an application. Permissions define what actions a specific user or role can perform. With Tortoise ORM, we can easily implement fine-grained access control and permission management.

## Setting Up Tortoise ORM {#setup}

First, let's set up Tortoise ORM in our project. Install the library using pip:

```python
pip install tortoise-orm
```

Next, configure the database connection details in your project's settings file. For example, if you are using PostgreSQL:

```python
from tortoise import Tortoise

TORTOISE_ORM = {
    "connections": {"default": "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database"},
    "apps": {"models": {"models": ["app.models", "aioauth.models"]}},
}
```

Make sure to replace `'username'`, `'password'`, `'localhost'`, `'5432'`, and `'database'` with your actual database connection details.

## Defining User and Permission Models {#models}

To manage access control and permissions, we need to define the `User` and `Permission` models. These models will be used to store user information and permissions, respectively.

```python
from tortoise import fields
from tortoise.models import Model


class User(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    username = fields.CharField(max_length=100)
    password = fields.CharField(max_length=100)
    permissions = fields.ManyToManyField('models.Permission', related_name='users')

class Permission(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    name = fields.CharField(max_length=100)
```

In the `User` model, we define a many-to-many relationship with the `Permission` model. It allows a user to have multiple permissions, and a permission can be assigned to multiple users.

## Implementing Access Control {#access-control}

To implement access control, we can define a decorator that checks if a user has the required permission. Here's an example:

```python
from functools import wraps
from tortoise.contrib.fastapi import HTTPException


def has_permission(permission: str):
    def decorator(handler_function):
        @wraps(handler_function)
        async def wrapper(request, *args, **kwargs):
            user_id = request.user.id
            user = await User.get(id=user_id).prefetch_related('permissions')
            
            if not any(permission.name == permission for permission in user.permissions):
                raise HTTPException(403, "Insufficient permissions")

            return await handler_function(request, *args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

In this example, the `has_permission` decorator takes a permission name as an argument. It checks if the authenticated user has that permission based on their associated permissions. If the user doesn't have the required permission, an HTTPException with a 403 status code is raised.

## Checking Permissions {#checking-permissions}

To check if a user has a specific permission, we can use the following code snippet:

```python
user = await User.get(id=user_id).prefetch_related('permissions')

if not any(permission.name == 'edit_post' for permission in user.permissions):
    # User doesn't have the required permission
```

Here, we fetch the user from the database and prefetch their associated permissions. We then iterate over the permissions to check if any of them have the required name.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Implementing access control and permissions is crucial for ensuring the security and proper functioning of your application. Tortoise ORM provides a convenient way to manage access control and permissions with its powerful modeling capabilities. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can easily implement access control and permission management in your Python applications using Tortoise ORM.
