Audio streaming is a process of sending and receiving audio data over a network in real-time. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement audio streaming using Pydub, a Python library for audio processing.

## Introduction to Pydub
Pydub is a simple and easy-to-use audio processing library for Python. It provides a high-level API for manipulating audio files, including streaming and converting between different audio formats. Pydub is built on top of popular audio processing libraries such as FFmpeg and libav.

## Installing Pydub
Before we can start implementing audio streaming with Pydub, we need to install the library. You can install Pydub using pip, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

```
pip install pydub
```

Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system as well, as Pydub relies on it for audio processing.

## Streaming Audio with Pydub
Now that we have Pydub installed, let's see how we can implement audio streaming using Pydub. We will assume that you have a source audio file that you want to stream.

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
from pydub.playback import play

def stream_audio(filename):
    audio = AudioSegment.from_file(filename)
    duration = len(audio)  # Duration of the audio in milliseconds
    chunk_size = 1000  # Time duration of each chunk in milliseconds
    start_position = 0  # Starting position for streaming

    while start_position < duration:
        end_position = start_position + chunk_size
        chunk = audio[start_position:end_position]
        play(chunk)
        start_position = end_position

# Usage
stream_audio("audio.mp3")
```

In the above code, we first import `AudioSegment` from `pydub` to load the audio file. We also import the `play` function from `pydub.playback` to play the audio chunks.

The `stream_audio` function takes the filename of the audio file as input. Inside the function, we load the audio file and calculate its duration. We then set the chunk size, which determines the time duration of each chunk of audio to be streamed.

We initiate a while loop where we stream the audio in chunks. We define the start and end positions for each chunk based on the chunk size. We extract the chunk using slicing and play it using the `play` function. Finally, we update the start position by adding the chunk size.

## Conclusion
Pydub provides a convenient way to implement audio streaming in Python. In this tutorial, we learned how to install Pydub and use it to stream audio files. You can further enhance the streaming functionality by adding networking components to transmit the audio chunks over a network.
