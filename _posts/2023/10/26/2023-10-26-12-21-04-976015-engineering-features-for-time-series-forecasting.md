Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on historical data points. To improve the accuracy of time series forecasts, it is often necessary to engineer features from the available data. Feature engineering involves creating new variables or transforming existing ones to capture underlying patterns or relationships.

In this blog post, we will explore some common feature engineering techniques that are useful for time series forecasting tasks.

Let's dive into each of these techniques in more detail.

## Moving Averages

Moving averages are widely used in time series analysis to smooth out noise and identify underlying trends. A moving average of order *n* is computed by taking the average of the *n* most recent data points. This technique helps in removing short-term fluctuations and highlighting long-term patterns.

## Lagged Variables

Lagged variables are features created by shifting the values of the target variable or other relevant variables backwards or forwards in time. These lagged variables can capture autocorrelation or dependencies between past and future values. For example, if we are forecasting sales, we can create features like lagged sales from the previous month or previous year.

## Seasonality

Seasonality refers to patterns that repeat at regular intervals, such as daily, weekly, or monthly. By capturing seasonality, we can account for recurring patterns and improve forecast accuracy. One common approach is to create dummy variables representing the different seasons and include them as features in the model.

## Trend

Trend represents the long-term direction or pattern in the data. By detrending the time series, we can focus on forecasting the residual component without the influence of the underlying trend. This can be done by fitting a regression model or by subtracting the moving average from the original data.

## Cyclical Patterns

Unlike seasonality, cyclical patterns do not repeat at fixed intervals. These patterns can have varying lengths and do not adhere to a strict periodicity. Identifying and capturing cyclical patterns can help improve forecasts by accounting for these non-repetitive fluctuations.

## Differencing

Differencing involves calculating the difference between consecutive observations in the time series. This technique helps in removing trends and making the series stationary, which is necessary for many time series forecasting models. Differencing can be performed once or multiple times depending on the level of non-stationarity in the data.

## Rolling Window Statistics

Rolling window statistics involve computing summary statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, or minimum/maximum, over a sliding window of fixed size. These statistics provide information about the recent trends or patterns in the data.

## Interactions

Interactions refer to the relationships between different variables. By creating interaction features, we can capture how the relationship between two variables changes over time. For example, if we have variables like price and quantity sold, we can create interaction features like price multiplied by quantity to capture their combined effect on sales.

## Time since Events

Time since events features measure the time elapsed since a specific event occurred. These features can be useful in capturing the impact of past events on future values. For example, if a product launch or promotion had a significant effect on sales, we can create a feature representing the time since the event and include it in the forecasting model.

## Conclusion

Feature engineering plays a crucial role in time series forecasting to capture relevant patterns and relationships in the data. The techniques mentioned in this blog post are some of the commonly used methods for engineering features for time series forecasting tasks. By carefully selecting and engineering features, we can improve the accuracy of our models and make more accurate predictions.
