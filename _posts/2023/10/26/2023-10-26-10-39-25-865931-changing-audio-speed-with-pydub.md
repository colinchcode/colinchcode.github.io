When it comes to audio manipulation in Python, one powerful library that you can use is **Pydub**. Pydub allows you to easily manipulate audio files by providing a high-level interface.

In this tutorial, we will learn how to change the speed of an audio file using Pydub.

## Installation

To begin, make sure you have Pydub installed. If you don't have it, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pydub
```

## Changing audio speed

First, we need to import the necessary modules from Pydub:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment
```

Next, we'll load the audio file using the `AudioSegment.from_file()` static method:

```python
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("path/to/audiofile.mp3")
```

Now, we can change the speed of the audio using the `speedup()` or `slowdown()` methods. The `speedup()` method increases the speed of the audio, while the `slowdown()` method decreases the speed:

```python
# Speeding up the audio by 10%
speed = 1.1  # increase speed by 10%
fast_audio = audio.speedup(playback_speed=speed)

# Slowing down the audio by 20%
speed = 0.8  # decrease speed by 20%
slow_audio = audio.slowdown(playback_speed=speed)
```

The `playback_speed` parameter specifies the speed at which the audio should be played. A value greater than 1 increases the speed, while a value less than 1 decreases the speed.

Finally, we can export the modified audio to a new file using the `export()` method:

```python
fast_audio.export("path/to/fast_audio.mp3", format="mp3")
slow_audio.export("path/to/slow_audio.mp3", format="mp3")
```

Make sure to provide the desired file path and format for the exported files.

## Full code example

Here's a full example that combines all the steps:

```python
from pydub import AudioSegment

# Load audio file
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("path/to/audiofile.mp3")

# Speed up the audio
speed = 1.1
fast_audio = audio.speedup(playback_speed=speed)

# Slow down the audio
speed = 0.8
slow_audio = audio.slowdown(playback_speed=speed)

# Export the modified audio
fast_audio.export("path/to/fast_audio.mp3", format="mp3")
slow_audio.export("path/to/slow_audio.mp3", format="mp3")
```

## Conclusion

Pydub makes it easy to change the speed of an audio file in Python. By using the `speedup()` and `slowdown()` methods, you can manipulate the audio playback speed. This can be useful for various applications, such as creating fast-forward or slow-motion effects.
