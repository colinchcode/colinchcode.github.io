[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io) is a popular gradient boosting library that excels in handling large datasets and achieving high accuracy in machine learning tasks. While XGBoost provides many built-in evaluation metrics, there might be cases where you need to use a custom metric that is not available by default. In this blog post, we will explore how to use custom evaluation metrics in XGBoost.

## What are evaluation metrics in XGBoost?

Evaluation metrics in XGBoost are used to measure the performance of the model during training and evaluation. Common evaluation metrics provided by XGBoost include log loss, error rate, and accuracy. These metrics help in assessing the model's ability to make accurate predictions and guide the training process by optimizing the desired objective.

## Implementing a custom evaluation metric

XGBoost allows you to define and use your own evaluation metrics by providing a custom Python function. This function should take two arguments: the predicted labels and the actual labels. It should calculate the metric value based on these inputs and return the result.

Here's an example of a custom evaluation metric in Python:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score

def custom_metric(y_pred, y_true):
    # Calculate the metric value
    metric_value = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred)

    return "custom_metric", metric_value
```

In this example, we are using `roc_auc_score` from scikit-learn to calculate the ROC AUC metric. You can replace this with any other metric calculation logic based on your requirements.

## Registering the custom evaluation metric

Once your custom evaluation metric function is defined, you need to register it with XGBoost using the `feval` parameter. This parameter accepts a callable object or a custom evaluation metric function.

Here's an example of registering the custom evaluation metric in XGBoost using `xgb.train`:

```python
import xgboost as xgb

params = {
    "objective": "binary:logistic",
    "eval_metric": custom_metric
}

# Train the XGBoost model
xgb_model = xgb.train(params, dtrain)

# Evaluate the model
eval_results = xgb_model.eval(dtest)
```

In this example, we set the `eval_metric` parameter to our custom metric function `custom_metric`. During the training and evaluation process, XGBoost will call this function to calculate the metric at each iteration.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we learned how to use custom evaluation metrics in XGBoost. By defining our own metric function and registering it with XGBoost, we can measure the performance of the model based on our specific requirements. This flexibility allows us to optimize the model to achieve the best possible results in various machine learning tasks.
