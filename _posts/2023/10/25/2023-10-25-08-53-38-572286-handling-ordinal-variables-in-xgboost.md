When working with machine learning models like XGBoost, we often encounter datasets that contain ordinal variables. Ordinal variables are categorical variables with a natural ordering or ranking.

In this blog post, we will discuss how to handle ordinal variables in XGBoost to ensure accurate model training and prediction.

## What are Ordinal Variables?

Ordinal variables are categorical variables that have a meaningful order or rank. For example, a dataset may have an "education" variable with categories like "high school", "college", and "master's degree". These categories have a natural ordering based on the level of education.

## Handling Ordinal Variables in XGBoost

XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting framework that can handle numerical and categorical variables. However, by default, XGBoost treats all categorical variables as nominal and does not consider their ordinality.

To handle ordinal variables in XGBoost, we need to encode them properly. Here are two common strategies:

### 1. Label Encoding

Label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category of the ordinal variable. The assigned values represent the order or ranking of the categories.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Create a LabelEncoder object
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()

# Fit the encoder on the ordinal variable
label_encoder.fit(ordinal_variable)

# Transform the ordinal variable
ordinal_variable_encoded = label_encoder.transform(ordinal_variable)
```

### 2. Ordinal Encoding

Ordinal encoding assigns numerical values to the categories based on their order or rank. You define the order explicitly and assign corresponding numerical values accordingly.

```python
# Define the order of the ordinal variable categories
ordinal_order = ['low', 'medium', 'high']

# Create a dictionary to map categories to numerical values
ordinal_mapping = {'low': 1, 'medium': 2, 'high': 3}

# Apply the ordinal encoding using the map function
ordinal_variable_encoded = ordinal_variable.map(ordinal_mapping)
```

## Benefits and Considerations

Handling ordinal variables properly in XGBoost has several benefits:

1. **Preserves Ordinal Information**: By encoding ordinal variables correctly, we retain the meaningful order information, allowing the model to make better predictions.

2. **Avoids Loss of Information**: Treating ordinal variables as nominal may result in the loss of valuable information during model training.

However, there are a few considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Choosing the Right Encoding Strategy**: Selecting the appropriate encoding strategy depends on the nature of the dataset and the relationship between the ordinal variable and the target variable. It's important to evaluate the impact of different strategies on model performance.

2. **Maintaining Consistency**: When using ordinal encoding, ensure consistency in handling the ordinal variable across training and prediction phases. Ensure that the order and numerical values remain the same.

## Conclusion

Handling ordinal variables in XGBoost is crucial to preserve their meaningful order and improve model accuracy. Label encoding and ordinal encoding are two common strategies to consider. Understanding the nature of the ordinal variables and evaluating different encoding strategies will help you make informed decisions and improve your model's performance.
