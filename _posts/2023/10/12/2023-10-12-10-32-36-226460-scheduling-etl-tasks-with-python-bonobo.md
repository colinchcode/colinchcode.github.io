In data engineering and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflows, it's often necessary to schedule and automate the execution of ETL tasks. One popular framework that can help with this is **Python Bonobo**. Bonobo allows you to define your ETL pipelines as a series of transformations and easily schedule their execution.

In this article, we will explore how to schedule ETL tasks using Bonobo, including its features and how to set up a simple schedule.

## What is Bonobo?
Bonobo is an open-source Python library that helps you build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines with a focus on simplicity and reusability. It provides a clean and pythonic way to define data transformations and execute them in a pipeline fashion.

Bonobo is designed to be easy to use and understand, making it a great choice for beginners in data engineering. It also offers advanced features such as lazy evaluation, parallel processing, and support for various data sources and sinks.

## Features of Bonobo
- **Simple and clean API**: Bonobo provides an intuitive API for defining ETL pipelines using familiar Python constructs.
- **Lazy evaluation**: Bonobo uses lazy evaluation, which means that data is only processed when needed, allowing for efficient memory usage.
- **Parallel processing**: Bonobo supports parallel processing, enabling faster execution of ETL tasks for large datasets.
- **Easy integration**: Bonobo seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries and frameworks, making it flexible and extendable.
- **Built-in support for various sources and sinks**: Bonobo provides built-in support for common data sources and sinks, such as CSV files, databases, and REST APIs.

## Scheduling ETL tasks with Bonobo
Now let's look at how to schedule ETL tasks using Bonobo. We will walk through an example of a simple ETL pipeline and how to set up a basic schedule using the built-in scheduling feature of Bonobo.

### Defining the ETL pipeline
Before we can schedule the ETL tasks, we need to define the actual pipeline. In this example, let's assume we have a CSV file containing customer data, and we want to transform it and load it into a database.

Here's an example of a basic ETL pipeline using Bonobo:

```python
import bonobo

def extract():
    # Code to read customer data from CSV file

def transform(record):
    # Code to transform the customer data

def load(record):
    # Code to load the transformed data into a database

graph = bonobo.Graph(extract, transform, load)
```

In this example, we define three functions `extract()`, `transform(record)`, and `load(record)`, which represent the different stages of the ETL pipeline. The `graph` object represents the pipeline and defines the order in which the functions should be executed.

### Scheduling the ETL tasks
Once we have defined the ETL pipeline, we can schedule its execution using the built-in scheduling feature of Bonobo. Bonobo provides a `Scheduler` class that allows you to schedule the pipeline to run at specific intervals.

Here's an example of how to set up a basic schedule for the ETL tasks:

```python
from bonobo import run

# Define the schedule
schedule = bonobo.Schedule().every(seconds=60)

# Run the pipeline on the defined schedule
run(graph, scheduler=schedule)
```

In this example, we create a `Schedule` object and define the interval at which we want the ETL tasks to run using the `every()` method. In this case, the `seconds` parameter is set to 60, indicating that the tasks should run every minute.

We then pass the `graph` object and the `schedule` object to the `run()` function, which starts the execution of the ETL pipeline based on the defined schedule.

That's it! With these few steps, you can easily schedule and automate your ETL tasks using Bonobo.
