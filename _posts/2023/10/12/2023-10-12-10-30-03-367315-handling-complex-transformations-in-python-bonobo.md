Python Bonobo is a powerful ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) framework that allows you to easily handle data processing tasks. While Bonobo provides a simple and intuitive way to define your data pipelines, it may become challenging when you need to perform complex transformations on your data. In this blog post, we will explore some strategies for handling complex transformations in Python Bonobo.

## Introduction
When working on data processing tasks, it's common to encounter scenarios where the required transformations are more complex than basic filtering or mapping operations. In such cases, it's important to have tools and techniques to handle these complexities.

## Defining Complex Transformations
Bonobo provides a variety of built-in functions for common transformations such as filtering, mapping, and aggregating data. However, when you need to perform complex transformations, you can define your own custom transform functions. These functions can accept multiple input streams, perform complex calculations, and generate one or more output streams.

## Splitting and Joining Data
One common scenario in complex transformations is splitting and joining data from multiple sources. Bonobo provides the `split` and `join` functions to handle these operations.

The `split` function allows you to split a single data stream into multiple output streams based on a condition. This is useful when you have a large dataset and you want to process different subsets of the data separately.

```python
import bonobo

def split_data(row):
    if row['category'] == 'A':
        yield 'output_a', row
    elif row['category'] == 'B':
        yield 'output_b', row

graph = bonobo.Graph()
graph.add_chain(
    bonobo.CsvReader('input.csv'),
    split_data,
    bonobo.CsvWriter('output_a.csv', mode='w'),
    bonobo.CsvWriter('output_b.csv', mode='w'),
)

bonobo.run(graph)
```

The `join` function allows you to merge multiple input streams into a single output stream. This is useful when you have processed different subsets of data separately and want to combine them back into a single dataset.

```python
import bonobo

def join_streams(stream_a, stream_b):
    for row_a, row_b in zip(stream_a, stream_b):
        yield {**row_a, **row_b}

graph = bonobo.Graph()
graph.add_chain(
    bonobo.CsvReader('input_a.csv'),
    bonobo.CsvReader('input_b.csv'),
    join_streams,
    bonobo.CsvWriter('output.csv', mode='w'),
)

bonobo.run(graph)
```

## Advanced Transformations with Custom Transform Functions
For more complex transformations, you can define your own custom transform functions. These functions can accept multiple input streams, perform any calculations or operations you need, and yield the transformed data.

```python
import bonobo

def complex_transform(row_a, row_b):
    # Perform complex calculations using both input streams
    transformed_data = ...

    yield transformed_data

graph = bonobo.Graph()
graph.add_chain(
    bonobo.CsvReader('input_a.csv'),
    bonobo.CsvReader('input_b.csv'),
    complex_transform,
    bonobo.CsvWriter('output.csv', mode='w'),
)

bonobo.run(graph)
```

## Conclusion
Handling complex transformations in Python Bonobo can be achieved by using split and join functions, as well as by defining custom transform functions. These techniques allow you to process and manipulate your data efficiently, no matter how complex the transformations may be.
