Python Bonobo is a powerful data processing library that allows you to build ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines in a declarative and easy-to-use manner. One of the key aspects of data processing is the ability to interact with various data sources, including SQL databases. In this blog post, we will explore how to combine Python Bonobo with SQL databases to perform data processing tasks.

## Introduction

Python Bonobo provides a simple and intuitive way to connect to SQL databases using the SQLAlchemy library. SQLAlchemy provides a unified interface to interact with various database engines.

In order to use Bonobo with SQL databases, you need to install the SQLAlchemy library:

```
pip install sqlalchemy
```

## Setting up the Database Connection

To establish a connection with a SQL database, we first need to configure the connection parameters. Here's an example of how to configure the connection to a SQLite database:

```python
import bonobo
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

def get_connection():
    engine = create_engine('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')
    connection = engine.connect()
    return connection

```

In the code above, we import the necessary libraries and define a `get_connection` function that sets up the connection to a SQLite database. You can replace the connection string with the appropriate one for your specific database.

## Extracting Data from a SQL Database

Once the database connection is established, we can extract data from the database using Bonobo's `ReadFromSQL` transformation. Here's an example of how to extract data from a table:

```python
@bonobo.transform
def extract_data(database_connection):
    query = 'SELECT * FROM mytable'
    result = database_connection.execute(query)
    for row in result:
        yield row
```

In this code snippet, we define a transformation function `extract_data` that takes the database connection as an argument. We construct a SQL query to retrieve the desired data and iterate over the result set, yielding each row.

## Transforming and Loading Data

Once the data is extracted, we can apply various transformations using Bonobo's transformation functions. For example, we can clean up the data, apply business rules, or perform calculations.

Finally, we can load the transformed data into another SQL database using the `WriteToSQL` transformation. Here's an example:

```python
@bonobo.transform
def transform_data(*args):
    # apply transformations to the data
    # ...

@bonobo.transform
def load_data(database_connection, *args):
    for data in args:
        # insert data into the database
        # ...

graph = bonobo.Graph(
    extract_data,
    transform_data,
    load_data,
)

with bonobo.parse_args() as options:
    bonobo.run(graph, services={
        'database_connection': get_connection()
    })

```

In the code above, we define transformation functions `transform_data` and `load_data`. The transformed data is then passed to the `load_data` function, which inserts it into the destination SQL database.

## Conclusion

Combining Python Bonobo with SQL databases provides a powerful toolset for building ETL pipelines. With Bonobo's easy-to-use interface and SQLAlchemy's versatility, you can extract, transform, and load data into SQL databases seamlessly. Whether you are working with SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, or any other supported database engine, Bonobo simplifies the process and allows you to focus on the data processing logic.

By leveraging Bonobo and SQL databases, you can efficiently process and transform data, enabling you to gain valuable insights and drive data-driven decision-making.
