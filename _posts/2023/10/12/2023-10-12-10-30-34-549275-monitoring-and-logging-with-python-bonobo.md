In today's fast-paced software development world, it's crucial to monitor and log the activities happening in our applications. Monitoring helps us understand the performance and health of our systems, while logging provides valuable insights into the execution flow, errors, and exceptions. In this blog post, we'll explore how to achieve monitoring and logging with Python Bonobo.

## What is Python Bonobo?

Python Bonobo is a lightweight Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) framework built for Python. It simplifies the process of working with data pipelines and provides a clean and Pythonic API to build powerful data integration pipelines. Bonobo allows you to define pipelines as simple functions, making it easy to understand and maintain.

## Monitoring with Python Bonobo

Monitoring our data pipelines is important to ensure they are running smoothly and efficiently. Bonobo offers a built-in monitoring capability that allows us to keep track of metrics such as input and output row counts, processing time, and error handling.

To enable monitoring in Bonobo, we need to implement a monitoring callback function and register it with our pipeline. The monitoring callback function is called at regular intervals during pipeline execution and can be used to collect and store pipeline metrics.

Here's an example of how to implement a monitoring callback function:

```python
import time

def monitoring_callback(context):
    start_time = time.time()
    # Collect and store metrics
    # Example: log input and output row counts
    input_rows = context.input_rows
    output_rows = context.output_rows
    print(f"Input rows: {input_rows}, Output rows: {output_rows}")

    # Example: log processing time
    processing_time = time.time() - start_time
    print(f"Processing time: {processing_time} seconds")
```

To register the monitoring callback function with our pipeline, we can use the `with` statement:

```python
import bonobo

def my_pipeline():
    # Define your pipeline logic here

bonobo.run(my_pipeline, services={'monitoring': monitoring_callback})
```

By using this approach, you can monitor the key metrics of your pipeline as it executes, ensuring the smooth operation of your data integration workflows.

## Logging with Python Bonobo

Logging allows us to capture information during execution, providing valuable insights into the behavior and issues of our data pipelines. Python Bonobo comes with built-in logging support, which you can use to log messages, errors, and exceptions.

To enable logging in Bonobo, you need to configure the logging system with your desired log levels and handlers. Let's look at an example:

```python
import logging
import bonobo

def my_pipeline():
    # Define your pipeline logic here
    logging.info("Pipeline started")

bonobo.run(my_pipeline)
```

In the above example, we used the `logging` module to log an informational message when the pipeline starts. You can use different log levels such as `info`, `debug`, `warning`, `error`, etc., depending on the severity of the message.

To configure the logging system, you can use the `basicConfig` function from the `logging` module. Here's an example:

```python
import logging
import bonobo

def my_pipeline():
    # Define your pipeline logic here
    logging.info("Pipeline started")

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
bonobo.run(my_pipeline)
```

In the above example, we set the log level to `INFO`, which means only `INFO` and higher level messages will be logged. You can customize the log level depending on your requirements.

## Conclusion

Monitoring and logging are crucial aspects of any data integration workflow. Python Bonobo provides built-in support for monitoring and logging, making it easy to track metrics and capture important information during pipeline execution. By leveraging Bonobo's monitoring and logging capabilities, you can ensure the smooth operation of your data pipelines and quickly identify and resolve any issues that may arise.

Now that you have a basic understanding of monitoring and logging with Python Bonobo, feel free to explore the documentation and start using these powerful features in your own data integration projects. Happy coding!
