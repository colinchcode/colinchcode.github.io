In today's digital landscape, building a robust and efficient REST API is crucial for any modern application. In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a REST API using ES6 syntax in combination with the popular Node.js framework, Express.js.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A basic understanding of JavaScript

## Setting up the Project

1. Create a new directory for your project.
```
$ mkdir my-rest-api
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
$ cd my-rest-api
```

3. Initialize a new Node.js project.
```
$ npm init -y
```

4. Install the required dependencies.
```
$ npm install express
```

## Creating the Server

1. Create a new file named `server.js` in the project directory.

2. Add the following code to `server.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Creating the API Endpoints

1. Create a new directory named `routes` in the project directory.

2. Inside the `routes` directory, create a new file named `api.js`.

3. Add the following code to `api.js`:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Get all users' });
});

router.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  res.json({ message: `Get user with ID ${id}` });
});

router.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Create a new user' });
});

module.exports = router;
```

4. In `server.js`, add the following code to import and use the `api` router:
```javascript
const apiRouter = require('./routes/api');
app.use('/api', apiRouter);
```

## Testing the API Endpoints

1. Start the server by running the following command in your project directory:
```
$ node server.js
```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/users`. You should see the JSON response: `{"message":"Get all users"}`.

3. Try other API endpoints such as `http://localhost:3000/api/users/1` and `http://localhost:3000/api/users` (using POST method).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to build a basic REST API using ES6 syntax and Express.js. Express.js provides a simple and intuitive way to handle HTTP requests and build scalable APIs. By following this guide, you should now have a solid foundation to expand and customize your own REST API.
