## What are Decorators?

Decorators are a powerful feature in ES6 that provide a way to modify or enhance the functionality of a class or its members like properties and methods. They allow you to add extra behaviors to your code without modifying its underlying implementation. Decorators are widely used in the Angular framework to enhance the functionality of components, services, and modules.

## Why use Decorators in Angular?

Decorators provide a clean and concise way to add functionality to Angular components. They help in reducing code duplication and make your code more modular and reusable. Decorators also enable you to separate cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, caching, or authentication, from the core business logic of your application.

## Using Decorators in Angular Components

To use decorators in Angular components, you need to import the `Component` decorator from the `@angular/core` module. Let's say we have a simple Angular component named `AppComponent`. We can enhance this component using decorators to achieve additional functionality.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'My Angular App';
  // additional properties and methods
}
```

In the above example, the `@Component` decorator is used to configure the `AppComponent` class. It takes an object as an argument, which contains various options such as `selector`, `templateUrl`, and `styleUrls`. These options define how the component should be rendered and styled.

## Creating Custom Decorators

You can also create your own custom decorators in Angular. Custom decorators allow you to encapsulate reusable functionality that can be applied to multiple components or services. Here's an example of a custom decorator that logs the execution time of a function:

```typescript
function logExecutionTime(target: any, name: string, descriptor: PropertyDescriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  
  descriptor.value = function(...args: any[]) {
    console.time(`Execution time of ${name}`);
    const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    console.timeEnd(`Execution time of ${name}`);
    return result;
  };
  
  return descriptor;
}

class MyComponent {
  @logExecutionTime
  public fetchData() {
    // Code to fetch data
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `logExecutionTime` decorator is applied to the `fetchData` method of the `MyComponent` class. It wraps the original method with additional code to log the execution time.

## Conclusion

ES6 decorators are a powerful feature that help in enhancing the functionality of Angular components. They provide a clean and concise way to add behaviors to your code and make it more modular and reusable. Whether you are using the built-in decorators in Angular or creating your own custom decorators, decorators are a useful tool to have in your Angular development toolbox.
