Caching and memoization are powerful techniques used in software development to optimize the performance of functions or methods that are computationally expensive or have heavy dependencies. These techniques help reduce the overall execution time by storing results and reusing them when the same input is encountered again.

In JavaScript, one way to implement caching and memoization is by using **ES6 Map Objects**. The `Map` object is a built-in data structure that allows you to store key-value pairs and provides efficient methods for retrieval and deletion.

Here's an example of how you can use `Map` objects for caching and memoization:

```javascript
// Create a new Map object
const cache = new Map();

// Define a function that performs time-consuming computation
function expensiveFunction(input) {
  // Check if the result is already cached
  if (cache.has(input)) {
    return cache.get(input);
  }

  // Perform the computation
  const result = performExpensiveComputation(input);

  // Cache the result for future use
  cache.set(input, result);

  return result;
}

// Helper function for performing the expensive computation
function performExpensiveComputation(input) {
  // ... perform the computation and return the result
}

// Usage example
const result1 = expensiveFunction('input1'); // Performs the computation and caches the result
const result2 = expensiveFunction('input1'); // Retrieves the result from cache
const result3 = expensiveFunction('input2'); // Performs the computation and caches the result

console.log(result1); // Output: computed result for input1
console.log(result2); // Output: computed result for input1 (retrieved from cache)
console.log(result3); // Output: computed result for input2
```

In the above code, we create a `Map` object named `cache` to store the cached results. The `expensiveFunction` checks if the result for a specific input is already present in the cache by using the `has` method. If it is, the cached result is retrieved using the `get` method and returned immediately. If the result is not in the cache, the function performs the expensive computation using the `performExpensiveComputation` helper function, caches the result using the `set` method, and then returns the result.

By using `Map` objects, we can easily implement caching and memoization in JavaScript. However, it's important to note that the cache will only persist for the lifetime of the `Map` object. If you need the cache to persist across multiple function calls or page reloads, you might consider storing it in a global variable or using alternative caching techniques.
