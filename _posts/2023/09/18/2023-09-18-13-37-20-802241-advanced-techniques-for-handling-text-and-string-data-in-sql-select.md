1. Concatenating Strings:
Concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings together. In SQL, you can use the concatenation operator (+ in most databases) to concatenate strings. For example:

```sql
SELECT first_name + ' ' + last_name AS full_name
FROM employees;
```

2. Substring Extraction:
Sometimes, you may need to extract a portion of a string from a column value. SQL provides functions like SUBSTRING or SUBSTR to achieve this. These functions allow you to extract a substring from a specified position with a given length or based on a pattern. For example:

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(description, 1, 10) AS short_description
FROM products;
```

3. String Length:
To calculate the length of a string, SQL provides functions such as LENGTH or LEN. These functions return the number of characters in a given string. For example:

```sql
SELECT product_name, LENGTH(product_name) AS name_length
FROM products;
```

4. String Manipulation:
SQL offers various string manipulation functions to modify or replace parts of a string. Some common functions include REPLACE, UPPER, LOWER, and REVERSE. These functions help in transforming the string data according to your requirements. For example:

```sql
SELECT REPLACE(product_name, 'old', 'new') AS modified_name
FROM products;
```

5. Pattern Matching:
Pattern matching allows you to search for specific text patterns within a string using wildcard characters. SQL offers pattern matching capabilities through the LIKE operator and the use of wildcards such as % (matches any sequence of characters) and _ (matches any single character). For example:

```sql
SELECT product_name
FROM products
WHERE product_name LIKE 'A%';
```

These advanced techniques for handling text and string data in SQL SELECT statements provide powerful capabilities to manipulate, extract, and analyze textual data efficiently. By utilizing these techniques, you can leverage the full potential of SQL for working with text-based data in your databases.
