In any database-driven application, security is a top priority. Controlling access to data and ensuring that users only see the information they are authorized to view is crucial. One way to achieve this level of security is by implementing row-level security in your SQL SELECT statements.

Row-level security allows you to restrict data access based on specific conditions or rules defined for each user or role. It ensures that users can only retrieve the rows that they are explicitly allowed to see, strengthening the overall security of your system.

## Setting up Row-Level Security

To implement row-level security, you'll need to perform the following steps:

### 1. Define the Security Policies

Start by defining the security policies that will govern the row-level security rules. These policies typically include the conditions or predicates that will determine which rows can be accessed by each user or role.

### 2. Attach Security Policies to Tables

Next, attach the defined security policies to the relevant tables. This step associates the policies with the tables and specifies how the security rules should be enforced when performing SELECT operations.

### 3. Filter Rows with Security Predicates

In your SQL SELECT statements, use the security predicates to filter the rows based on the defined security policies. These predicates should be applied to the WHERE clause of the SELECT statement to restrict access to the authorized rows only.

## Example Implementation

Let's illustrate row-level security implementation with an example. Consider a table named `customers` with columns `id`, `name`, and `country`. We want to restrict access to customers based on their country. Only users from the same country should be able to view the corresponding customer records.

First, define the security policy by specifying the country condition for each user or role:

```
CREATE SECURITY POLICY country_policy
	ADD FILTER PREDICATE (country = USER);
```

Next, attach the security policy to the `customers` table:

```
ALTER TABLE customers
  ADD SECURITY POLICY country_policy;
```

Now, when executing a SELECT statement, apply the security predicate:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country = CURRENT_USER;
```

This SQL SELECT statement will only return the customers that match the country of the current user.

## Conclusion

Implementing row-level security in SQL SELECT statements provides granular control over data access, ensuring that users only see the data they are authorized to view. By defining security policies, attaching them to tables, and utilizing security predicates in SELECT statements, you can enforce row-level security for your database-driven application.
