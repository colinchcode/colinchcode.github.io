In SQL, temporary tables are a useful tool for storing intermediate data that you can use within a specific session or query. The temporary table is only visible to the current user and is automatically dropped when the session ends.

## Creating a Temporary Table

To create a temporary table, you can use the `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE` statement followed by the table name and the column definitions. For example:

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

This will create a temporary table called `temp_table` with two columns: `id` of type `INT` and `name` of type `VARCHAR(50)`.

## Populating a Temporary Table

Once the temporary table is created, you can populate it with data using `INSERT INTO` statements, just like you would with a regular table. For example:

```sql
INSERT INTO temp_table (id, name)
VALUES (1, 'John'),
       (2, 'Jane'),
       (3, 'Alice');
```

This will insert three rows into the `temp_table`.

## Using a Temporary Table in a SELECT Statement

To use the temporary table in a `SELECT` statement, you can join it with other tables or use it directly in the query. For example:

```sql
SELECT t.name, other_table.column
FROM temp_table t
JOIN other_table ON t.id = other_table.id
WHERE t.id > 1;
```

In this example, we select the `name` column from the `temp_table` and the `column` from another table called `other_table`. We join the two tables based on the `id` column and filter the result to include only rows where the `id` is greater than 1.

## Dropping a Temporary Table

As mentioned earlier, temporary tables are automatically dropped when the session ends. However, you can also explicitly drop them using the `DROP TEMPORARY TABLE` statement. For example:

```sql
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE temp_table;
```

This will remove the temporary table called `temp_table`.

## Conclusion

Temporary tables are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to store intermediate data within a session or query. They can greatly simplify complex queries and improve performance. Remember to use them wisely and drop them when they are no longer needed.
