In SQL, a self join is a technique where a table is joined with itself. It allows you to combine rows from the same table based on a related column. Self joins are commonly used when you have hierarchical or recursive data structures.

Self joins can be a powerful tool in SQL, but they can also be complex to understand and use effectively. In this article, we will dive deep into the concept of self joins and explore some examples.

## Understanding Self Joins

A self join is performed by joining a table to itself using different aliases. By using aliases, we can distinguish between the original table and the table that is being joined.

To perform a self join, you need to have a column in the table that establishes a relationship between the rows. This relationship can be established by having a foreign key column that points to the primary key of the same table.

## Example Scenario: Employees and Managers

Let's consider a scenario where we have a table called `employees` with the following structure:

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1           | John          | NULL       |
| 2           | Mary          | 1          |
| 3           | Mark          | 2          |
| 4           | Sarah         | 1          |

In this example, the `manager_id` column relates each employee to their respective manager. The top-level manager has a `NULL` value in the `manager_id` column.

## Querying the Employees Hierarchy

### Scenario 1: Retrieving Employees and Their Managers

To retrieve a list of employees along with their respective managers, we can use a self join. We join the `employees` table with itself, using the `manager_id` column as the key.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, m.employee_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

In this query, we use aliases `e` and `m` to differentiate between the employee table and the manager table. The result will provide a list of employees and their respective managers.

### Scenario 2: Retrieving Employees and Their Subordinates

To obtain a list of employees and their subordinates, the self join is used in a slightly different way. We need to reverse the relationship by joining the table on the `manager_id` column of the manager with the `employee_id` column of the employee.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, s.employee_name AS subordinate_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees s ON s.manager_id = e.employee_id;
```

This query will return a list of employees and their subordinates.

## Conclusion

Self joins are a powerful SQL technique that allows you to combine rows from the same table based on a related column. By understanding how to use self joins effectively, you can gain greater control and flexibility in querying hierarchical or recursive data structures.
