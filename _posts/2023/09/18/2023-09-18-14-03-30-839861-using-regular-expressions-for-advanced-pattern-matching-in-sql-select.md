Before diving into the implementation, it's important to note that not all database management systems support regular expressions directly in their SQL syntax. For this example, we will use the syntax supported by PostgreSQL, but it may vary depending on the database you are using.

Let's say we have a table called "products" with the following columns: "id", "name", and "description". We want to select all products whose names start with the letter 'A' and contain at least one digit in their description.

Here's how we can achieve this using regular expressions in SQL SELECT:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name ~ '^A' AND description ~ '[0-9]+';
```

In the above example, the `~` operator is used to indicate that we want to apply a regular expression match. The `^` symbol in the first regular expression pattern '^A' signifies that the name should start with the letter 'A'. The `[0-9]+` pattern in the second regular expression indicates that the description should contain at least one digit.

If we want to make the regular expression matching case insensitive, we can use the `~*` operator instead:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE name ~* '^a' AND description ~* '[0-9]+';
```

The `~*` operator performs a case-insensitive match.

Regular expressions can also be used in combination with other SQL operators such as LIKE or ILIKE to further refine the pattern matching logic.

In conclusion, regular expressions provide a flexible way to perform advanced pattern matching in SQL SELECT statements. By leveraging the power of regular expressions, you can extract specific data based on custom patterns, making your SQL queries more robust and flexible. Start using regular expressions in your SQL queries today and unlock the full potential of pattern matching in your database operations.
