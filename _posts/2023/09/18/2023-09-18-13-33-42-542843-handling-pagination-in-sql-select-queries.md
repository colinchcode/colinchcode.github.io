In many applications, it is common to have a large dataset that needs to be displayed in smaller, more manageable chunks called pages. Pagination allows users to navigate through these pages of data, improving user experience and reducing the load on the database server.

In this blog post, we will explore how to handle pagination in SQL SELECT queries. We will focus on the two most common pagination techniques: offset-based pagination and keyset pagination.

## Offset-Based Pagination

Offset-based pagination involves using the `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` clauses in the SQL query to retrieve a specific subset of rows from a table. The `OFFSET` clause specifies the number of rows to skip, and the `LIMIT` clause determines the maximum number of rows to return.

Here's an example of how to use offset-based pagination in a SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name
OFFSET 10  -- Skip the first 10 rows
LIMIT 10;  -- Retrieve 10 rows
```

In the above query, we skip the first 10 rows and retrieve the next 10 rows, effectively returning the second page of results.

While offset-based pagination is easy to implement, it can be inefficient and resource-intensive for large datasets. As the offset increases, the database server needs to scan through and skip a significant number of rows, resulting in slower performance.

## Keyset Pagination

Keyset pagination, also known as "seek method," provides a more efficient way to paginate through a dataset. Instead of using offsets, it relies on unique values or keys in the data to determine the starting point for each page.

To implement keyset pagination, perform a query using a `WHERE` clause that specifies the key value for the starting point of the next page. The `ORDER BY` clause is crucial for keyset pagination, as it ensures consistent ordering of the results.

Here's an example of how to use keyset pagination in a SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM table_name
WHERE column_value > last_page_value
ORDER BY column_name
LIMIT 10;  -- Retrieve 10 rows
```

In the above query, we specify the key value (`column_value`) from the last row of the previous page as our starting point. By doing this, we ensure that only the relevant rows for the current page are retrieved.

Keyset pagination is generally more performant than offset-based pagination, especially for large datasets where skipping rows becomes a problem.

## Conclusion

Pagination is an essential technique for handling large datasets in SQL SELECT queries. While offset-based pagination is straightforward to implement, it can be inefficient for large datasets due to the need to skip rows. On the other hand, keyset pagination offers a more efficient approach by utilizing unique values or keys to determine the starting point of each page.

Understanding the advantages and drawbacks of these pagination techniques can help you optimize the performance of your application and provide a better user experience.
