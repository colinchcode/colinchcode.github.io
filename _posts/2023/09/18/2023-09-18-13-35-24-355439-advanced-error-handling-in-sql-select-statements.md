Handling errors is an essential aspect of programming, especially when working with databases. In SQL, we can use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from database tables. In this blog post, we will explore advanced error handling techniques that can be used in SQL SELECT statements to improve the robustness of our code.

## The TRY-CATCH Block

SQL Server provides the TRY-CATCH block, which allows us to catch and handle errors that occur during the execution of our SQL statements. The TRY block contains the code that may cause an error, while the CATCH block handles the error if it occurs.

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    -- SQL statements that may cause an error
    SELECT * FROM non_existent_table;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Code to handle the error
    PRINT 'An error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

In the example above, we attempt to select data from a nonexistent table. If an error occurs, the CATCH block will be executed, and the error message will be printed.

## Error Severity Levels

SQL Server assigns severity levels to different types of errors. By checking the severity level of an error, we can determine how to handle it appropriately. The severity level can be accessed using the `ERROR_SEVERITY()` function.

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    -- SQL statements that may cause an error
    SELECT * FROM non_existent_table;
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Code to handle the error based on severity level
    IF ERROR_SEVERITY() > 10
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'A severe error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END
    ELSE
    BEGIN
        PRINT 'A less severe error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
    END
END CATCH;
```

In the example above, we check if the error severity level is greater than 10. If it is, we handle the error as a severe error; otherwise, we handle it as a less severe error.

## RAISERROR Statement

The RAISERROR statement allows us to generate our own user-defined errors in SQL. We can use this statement in conjunction with the TRY-CATCH block to provide custom error messages and handle specific scenarios.

```sql
BEGIN TRY
    -- SQL statements that may cause an error
    IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM important_table) = 0
    BEGIN
        DECLARE @msg VARCHAR(50) = 'No data in important_table';
        RAISERROR(@msg, 16, 1);
    END
END TRY
BEGIN CATCH
    -- Code to handle the error and print the custom message
    PRINT 'An error occurred: ' + ERROR_MESSAGE();
END CATCH;
```

In the example above, we check if there is any data in the `important_table`. If not, we raise a user-defined error with a custom message. The error is then caught in the CATCH block, and the error message is printed.

## Conclusion

Advanced error handling techniques in SQL SELECT statements, such as the TRY-CATCH block, error severity levels, and the RAISERROR statement, can greatly improve the robustness of our code. By anticipating and handling errors effectively, we can minimize disruptions and ensure better data integrity in our database operations.
