When working with databases, it is common to encounter scenarios where we need to perform complex data transformations during the retrieval process. These transformations can involve conditional logic, making them more challenging to implement. In SQL, one powerful tool for handling such transformations is the `CASE` statement.

The `CASE` statement allows us to define conditional expressions within the `SELECT` clause, enabling us to create custom result sets based on the conditions we specify. It follows a simple syntax:

```sql
SELECT 
  column1,
  column2,
  CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ELSE result3
  END AS transformed_column
FROM 
  table;
```

Let's explore a practical example. Suppose we have a table called "students" with columns for their names, ages, and grades. We want to retrieve their names along with a custom label based on their grade. In this case, we can use a `CASE` statement to handle the transformation:

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  CASE
    WHEN grade >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
    WHEN grade >= 80 THEN 'Good'
    WHEN grade >= 70 THEN 'Average'
    ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
  END AS grade_label
FROM 
  students;
```

In this example, the `CASE` statement checks the value of the "grade" column for each row. Depending on the grade range, it assigns a corresponding label to the "grade_label" column.

The `CASE` statement is also versatile enough to handle more complex transformations. For instance, we can combine multiple conditions using logical operators (`AND` and `OR`) to evaluate more specific scenarios:

```sql
SELECT 
  name,
  CASE
    WHEN grade >= 90 AND gender = 'M' THEN 'Excellent (Male)'
    WHEN grade >= 90 AND gender = 'F' THEN 'Excellent (Female)'
    WHEN grade >= 80 THEN 'Good'
    WHEN grade >= 70 THEN 'Average'
    ELSE 'Needs Improvement'
  END AS grade_label
FROM 
  students;
```

In this updated example, we consider the gender of the student alongside the grade. This allows us to create distinct labels for excellent grades based on gender while applying the same labels for other grades.

By leveraging the power of `CASE` statements in SQL `SELECT` queries, we gain the ability to handle complex data transformations in a concise and efficient manner. The flexibility of `CASE` allows us to define custom conditions and generate meaningful results based on our specific requirements.
