In SQL Server, implementing pagination efficiently is essential to enhance user experience and optimize query performance. Cursor-based pagination with keyset-based scrolling is a popular technique that enables efficient retrieval of paginated data without the need to count the total number of results.

## What is Cursor-Based Pagination with Keyset-Based Scrolling?

Cursor-based pagination with keyset-based scrolling is a technique that uses a combination of cursors and keysets to paginate through large result sets effectively. The approach revolves around using a unique identifier or keyset of the last fetched record to determine the starting point for the next page.

## Step-by-Step Implementation in SQL Server

Let's walk through the implementation of cursor-based pagination with keyset-based scrolling in SQL Server:

1. **Order the Result Set:** To implement keyset-based scrolling, it's crucial to have your result set ordered by a unique column or set of columns. For example, if you have a table of users, you can order the result set by the unique user ID.

2. **Declare and Open a Cursor:** Declare a cursor using the `DECLARE CURSOR` statement and associate it with the ordered result set using the `SELECT` statement. For instance:
   ```sql
   DECLARE @cursor CURSOR
   DECLARE @keyset NVARCHAR(MAX)

   SET @cursor = CURSOR FORWARD_ONLY STATIC FOR
   SELECT keysetColumn, otherColumns
   FROM yourTable
   ORDER BY keysetColumn ASC
   OPEN @cursor
   ```

3. **Fetch Data for a Page:** Use the `FETCH` statement to retrieve a specified number of rows for a given page. The keyset column value from the last fetched row serves as the reference for the starting point of the next page. Here's an example:
   ```sql
   FETCH NEXT FROM @cursor INTO @keyset, otherColumns
   ```

4. **Use the Fetched Data:** Process and display the fetched data for the current page. You could return the result set to an application or use it for further processing.

5. **Repeat for Next Pages:** To fetch the next page of data, repeat the `FETCH NEXT` statement using the previous keyset value as the starting point. Keep fetching until you reach the desired number of rows or until there are no more rows to fetch.

6. **Close and Deallocate the Cursor:** After all the required data has been fetched, close and deallocate the cursor using the `CLOSE` and `DEALLOCATE` statements, respectively.

## Benefits of Cursor-Based Pagination with Keyset-Based Scrolling

Cursor-based pagination with keyset-based scrolling provides several benefits compared to traditional offset-based pagination:

- Improved Query Performance: This technique avoids the need to generate and scan a large number of rows for each page, resulting in improved query performance as the data size grows.

- Consistent Results: Unlike offset-based pagination, keyset-based scrolling ensures consistent results, even if new rows are inserted or existing rows are updated or deleted during pagination.

- Scalability and Flexibility: Keyset-based scrolling scales better with large result sets and allows users to jump to specific pages without the performance degradation associated with offset-based pagination.
