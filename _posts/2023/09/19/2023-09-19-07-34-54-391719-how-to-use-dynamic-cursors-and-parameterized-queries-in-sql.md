In the world of SQL, dynamic cursors and parameterized queries are powerful tools that can greatly enhance the efficiency and security of your database operations. Let's dive into how you can effectively use these features.

## Dynamic Cursors

Dynamic cursors in SQL can be used to dynamically process and retrieve result sets. They allow you to iterate over rows in a result set and fetch data as needed. Here's an example of how to use dynamic cursors in SQL:

```sql
DECLARE @EmployeeID INT
DECLARE @FirstName VARCHAR(50)
DECLARE @LastName VARCHAR(50)

DECLARE DynamicCursor CURSOR FOR 
SELECT EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 50000

OPEN DynamicCursor

FETCH NEXT FROM DynamicCursor INTO @EmployeeID, @FirstName, @LastName

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    PRINT 'Employee ID: ' + CONVERT(VARCHAR(10), @EmployeeID)
    PRINT 'First Name: ' + @FirstName
    PRINT 'Last Name: ' + @LastName

    FETCH NEXT FROM DynamicCursor INTO @EmployeeID, @FirstName, @LastName
END

CLOSE DynamicCursor
DEALLOCATE DynamicCursor
```

In the example above, the dynamic cursor is declared and opened to retrieve employee records from the `Employees` table where the salary is greater than 50000. The fetched data is then iterated over and printed using a loop until all the rows have been processed.

## Parameterized Queries

Parameterized queries are essential in preventing SQL injection attacks and improving the performance of your SQL statements. They use placeholders for the values that need to be supplied at runtime, making them more secure and reusable. Here's an example of how to use parameterized queries in SQL:

```sql
DECLARE @FirstName VARCHAR(50) = 'John'
DECLARE @LastName VARCHAR(50) = 'Doe'

SELECT *
FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName = @FirstName
AND LastName = @LastName
```

In the example above, the query specifies placeholders `@FirstName` and `@LastName` instead of hardcoding the values. These placeholders can be supplied with specific values at runtime, safeguarding against malicious input and allowing for easy reuse.

Parameterized queries also enhance the performance of your SQL statements as the database can cache and reuse execution plans. This eliminates the overhead of parsing and optimizing the query every time it is executed.

## Conclusion

Dynamic cursors and parameterized queries are powerful features in SQL that can enhance the flexibility, security, and performance of your database operations. By leveraging these features, you can write more efficient and secure SQL code with ease.
