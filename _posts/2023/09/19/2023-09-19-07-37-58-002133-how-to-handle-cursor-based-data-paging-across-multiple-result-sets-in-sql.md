In certain scenarios, dealing with large datasets in a database requires efficient techniques for pagination. One common technique is cursor-based paging, which allows for sequential retrieval of data by using a cursor to navigate through result sets. However, when dealing with multiple result sets, an additional level of complexity arises.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to handle cursor-based data paging across multiple result sets in SQL, which can greatly improve the performance and scalability of your applications.

## Understanding Cursor-Based Paging

Cursor-based paging involves using a cursor to navigate through the result set of a query in smaller chunks (pages) rather than fetching the entire dataset in a single query. This approach minimizes the memory footprint, network bandwidth, and processing time required to retrieve the data.

The basic idea behind cursor-based paging is to define a cursor with a specific ordering criterion (e.g., ID or timestamp) and then use the FETCH NEXT and FETCH PRIOR statements to move the cursor forward and backward, respectively. By specifying the number of rows to fetch, we can control the size of each page.

## Handling Multiple Result Sets

When dealing with a large dataset, it may not be feasible or efficient to fetch all the data in a single result set. Instead, it's common to divide the data into multiple result sets based on some criteria (e.g., time range or category).

To handle multiple result sets, we can use a combination of cursor-based paging and nested cursor loops. The outer cursor loop retrieves the result sets, while the inner cursor loop processes each individual result set.

Here's an example code snippet demonstrating how to handle multiple result sets in SQL Server:

```sql
DECLARE @pageIndex int = 1;
DECLARE @pageSize int = 100;

DECLARE resultCursor CURSOR FOR
    SELECT * FROM YourData
    ORDER BY SomeColumn;

OPEN resultCursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM resultCursor INTO ...;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    -- Process the current result set

    -- Inner cursor loop
    DECLARE @innerPageIndex int = 1;
    DECLARE @innerPageSize int = 10;

    DECLARE innerCursor CURSOR FOR
        SELECT * FROM YourData
        WHERE SomeColumn = @someValue
        ORDER BY AnotherColumn;

    OPEN innerCursor;
    FETCH NEXT FROM innerCursor INTO ...;

    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN
        -- Process the current row

        FETCH NEXT FROM innerCursor INTO ...;
    END

    CLOSE innerCursor;
    DEALLOCATE innerCursor;

    -- Move to the next result set

    FETCH NEXT FROM resultCursor INTO ...;
END

CLOSE resultCursor;
DEALLOCATE resultCursor;
```

In this example, we have an outer cursor loop that retrieves the result sets from the `YourData` table, ordered by `SomeColumn`. Within each iteration of the outer loop, we have an inner cursor loop that processes the individual result sets based on additional criteria (e.g., `SomeColumn = @someValue`).

## Conclusion

Efficiently handling cursor-based data paging across multiple result sets in SQL is essential for optimizing the performance and scalability of applications that deal with large datasets. By combining cursor-based paging with nested cursor loops, you can fetch and process the data in smaller, manageable chunks.

Remember to optimize your SQL queries, use appropriate indexing, and consider additional performance tuning techniques to further enhance the efficiency of your cursor-based paging implementation.
