Dealing with large result sets can be a challenge in SQL, especially when memory efficiency is a concern. One approach to efficiently handle large result sets is to use SQL cursors. Cursors allow you to fetch a small subset of rows at a time, minimizing the memory required to process the data.

## What is a SQL Cursor?

A cursor is a database object that allows you to retrieve and manipulate the rows returned by a SELECT statement. It provides a mechanism for iterative processing of query results, fetching a small number of rows at a time.

## Using Cursors for Large Result Sets

To handle a large result set using cursors, follow these steps:

1. **Declare a Cursor**: Start by declaring a cursor and associating it with a SELECT statement. This statement defines the result set you want to process. For example:

   ```sql
   DECLARE my_cursor CURSOR FOR 
   SELECT column1, column2 FROM table;
   ```

2. **Open the Cursor**: Once you've declared the cursor, you need to open it to make the result set available for processing. The OPEN statement is used to achieve this:

   ```sql
   OPEN my_cursor;
   ```

3. **Fetch Rows**: After opening the cursor, you can fetch a specified number of rows using the FETCH statement. Fetching a limited number of rows at a time helps conserve memory. For example, to fetch 100 rows:

   ```sql
   FETCH NEXT 100 ROWS FROM my_cursor;
   ```

4. **Process the Rows**: Once you have fetched the rows, you can process them as needed. This can involve performing calculations, applying business logic, or updating other tables.

   ```sql
   WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
   BEGIN
     -- Perform processing on fetched row(s)
     -- ...

     FETCH NEXT 100 ROWS FROM my_cursor; -- Fetch next set of rows
   END 
   ```

5. **Close the Cursor**: After processing all the rows, close the cursor to release the associated resources:

   ```sql
   CLOSE my_cursor;
   ```

6. **Deallocate the Cursor**: Finally, deallocate the cursor to free up memory:

   ```sql
   DEALLOCATE my_cursor;
   ```

By fetching a limited number of rows at a time and processing them iteratively, you can efficiently handle large result sets without consuming excessive memory.
