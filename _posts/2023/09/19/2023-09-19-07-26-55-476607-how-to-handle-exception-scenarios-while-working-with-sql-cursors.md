Working with SQL cursors can lead to exceptions and errors if not handled properly. In this article, we will explore various exception scenarios that can occur while working with SQL cursors and discuss how to handle them effectively.

## 1. Declaring the Cursor

Before delving into exception handling, let's quickly review the process of declaring a cursor in SQL:

```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR [LOCAL | GLOBAL] [FORWARD_ONLY | SCROLL]
FOR select_statement;
```

## 2. Exception Scenarios

### 2.1. Cursor Not Found

One common exception scenario occurs when attempting to fetch data from a cursor that has not been initialized or is empty. To handle this situation, we can check if the cursor is open and has rows to fetch:

```sql
BEGIN
    -- Declare and open the cursor
    DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement;
    OPEN cursor_name;

    -- Check if cursor has rows
    IF @@CURSOR_ROWS > 0
        -- Fetch rows from the cursor
        FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_name INTO variable_name;
    
    -- Continue with other operations
END
```

### 2.2. Cursor Already Open

Another exception scenario is when the cursor is already open and an attempt is made to open it again. The solution is to check if the cursor is open before attempting to open it:

```sql
BEGIN
    -- Declare and open the cursor if not already open
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM sys.dm_exec_cursors(NULL) WHERE name = 'cursor_name')
        DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement;
        OPEN cursor_name;

    -- Continue with other operations
END
```

### 2.3. Cursor Already Closed

If the cursor is already closed and we try to fetch data from it, an exception will be thrown. To avoid this, we can check if the cursor is still open before fetching:

```sql
BEGIN
    -- Declare and open the cursor
    DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement;
    OPEN cursor_name;

    -- Check if cursor is open
    IF status = 1
        -- Fetch rows from the cursor
        FETCH NEXT FROM cursor_name INTO variable_name;

    -- Continue with other operations
END
```

## Conclusion

Handling exceptions while working with SQL cursors is crucial to prevent errors and ensure smooth execution of your code. By implementing proper exception handling techniques as described above, you can handle various scenarios effectively, providing a robust and error-free experience.
