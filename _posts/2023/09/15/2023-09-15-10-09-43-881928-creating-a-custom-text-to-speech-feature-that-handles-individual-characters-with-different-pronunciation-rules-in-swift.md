## Introduction

In this blog post, we will discuss how to create a custom text-to-speech feature in Swift that handles individual characters with different pronunciation rules. Text-to-speech (TTS) is a very useful technology that converts written text into spoken words, enabling applications to support accessibility and improve user experience. By customizing the pronunciation rules for specific characters, we can enhance the accuracy and naturalness of the generated speech.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- Xcode IDE installed on your system

## Implementation

1. **Import AVFoundation Framework:**

   We will be using the `AVSpeechSynthesizer` class from the `AVFoundation` framework to generate the speech. Import the framework by adding the following line at the top of your Swift file:

   ```swift
   import AVFoundation
   ```

2. **Create a Speech Synthesizer:**

   Create an instance of `AVSpeechSynthesizer` as follows:

   ```swift
   let speechSynthesizer = AVSpeechSynthesizer()
   ```

3. **Define Custom Pronunciation Rules:**

   To handle individual characters with different pronunciation rules, we need to define a dictionary that maps characters to their desired pronunciation. For example, let's define a dictionary that changes the pronunciation of the character 'A' to 'uh' instead of the default pronunciation:

   ```swift
   let pronunciationRules: [String: String] = ["A": "uh"]
   ```

4. **Create an Utterance with Custom Pronunciation:**

   When creating an `AVSpeechUtterance` object, set its `speechString` property to the desired text and modify the pronunciation with the help of `SSML` (Speech Synthesis Markup Language). In the example below, we set the utterance text to "Hello, how are you?" and modify the pronunciation of 'A' using the custom pronunciation rules defined earlier:

   ```swift
   let utterance = AVSpeechUtterance(string: "Hello, how are you?")
   utterance.speechString = utterance.speechString.replacingOccurrences(of: "A", with: "<phoneme alphabet='x-sampa' ph='\(pronunciationRules["A"] ?? "")'>A</phoneme>")
   ```

5. **Speak the Utterance:**

   Finally, use the `speak(_:)` method of the speech synthesizer instance to speak the utterance:

   ```swift
   speechSynthesizer.speak(utterance)
   ```

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we discussed how to create a custom text-to-speech feature in Swift that handles individual characters with different pronunciation rules. By following the steps outlined above, you can enhance the accuracy and naturalness of the generated speech by customizing the pronunciation. Experiment with different pronunciation rules to create a more personalized and engaging user experience in your applications.
