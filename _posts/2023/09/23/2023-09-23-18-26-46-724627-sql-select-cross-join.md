When working with relational databases, you often come across situations where you need to combine every row from one table with every row from another table. This can be achieved using a CROSS JOIN operation in SQL.

The CROSS JOIN operation creates a Cartesian product by combining every row from the first table with every row from the second table. This results in a new table where the number of rows is equal to the product of the number of rows in the two tables being joined.

The syntax for a CROSS JOIN operation in SQL is as follows:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

Let's take a look at an example to better understand how to perform a CROSS JOIN in SQL.

Assume we have two tables: `employees` and `departments`. The `employees` table contains information about employees such as `employee_id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. The `departments` table contains information about departments such as `department_id` and `department_name`.

We want to create a new table that combines each employee with every department to show all possible combinations.

Here's how the SQL query for this cross join operation would look like:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

This will yield a result set with every possible combination of an employee from the `employees` table with a department from the `departments` table.

It is worth noting that cross joining large tables can result in a very large result set, so it's important to use cross joins judiciously.

In conclusion, the cross join operation in SQL allows you to combine every row from one table with every row from another table. It can be a powerful tool when used appropriately. Make sure to consider the potential size of the result set before using cross joins, and always test your queries on sample data before running them on large datasets.
