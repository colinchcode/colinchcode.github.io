When working with SQL, the `CASE WHEN` statement is a powerful tool that allows you to perform conditional logic within a `SELECT` query. You can use it to retrieve different values or perform calculations based on specific conditions. In some cases, you might need to include nested `SELECT` statements within a `CASE WHEN` clause to achieve more complex logic.

Here is an example of using the `CASE WHEN` statement with nested `SELECT` statements in SQL:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2,
  CASE 
    WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table2) > 0 THEN 'Condition met'
    ELSE 'Condition not met'
  END AS condition_result
FROM table1;
```

In this example, we have a `SELECT` query that retrieves values from `table1`. The `CASE WHEN` statement is used to check if there are any rows in `table2` using a nested `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table2` statement. If the count is greater than 0, the result will be 'Condition met'. Otherwise, it will be 'Condition not met'. The `AS` keyword is used to give the result column a meaningful name (`condition_result`) in the result set.

Nested `SELECT` statements can be used to perform more advanced conditions within the `CASE WHEN` statement. You can include aggregate functions, subqueries, or even joins to retrieve data based on specific criteria.

Remember to replace `column1`, `column2`, `table1`, and `table2` with your actual table and column names in your database.

Using nested `SELECT` statements within a `CASE WHEN` clause can enhance the flexibility and power of your SQL queries. It allows you to perform complex logic and retrieve conditional data based on specific criteria. Experiment with different scenarios and make sure to optimize your queries for better performance.
