When working with data in SQL, there may be times when you need to calculate the average value of a column. In such cases, the `AVG` function comes in handy.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of the `AVG` function is as follows:

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;
```
Where `column_name` is the name of the column for which you want to calculate the average, and `table_name` is the name of the table from which you want to retrieve data.

## Example

Let's assume we have a table named `students` with the following structure:

| student_id | name   | marks |
|------------|--------|-------|
| 1          | John   | 90    |
| 2          | Alice  | 85    |
| 3          | Michael| 95    |
| 4          | Emma   | 70    |
| 5          | James  | 80    |

To calculate the average marks of all the students, we can use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(marks) FROM students;
```

This query will return the average value of the `marks` column, which in this case would be `84`.

## Conclusion

The `AVG` function in SQL allows you to easily calculate the average value of a column. By using this function, you can gain insights into your data and make informed decisions based on the average values. So next time you need to calculate an average in SQL, don't forget to use the handy `AVG` function!
