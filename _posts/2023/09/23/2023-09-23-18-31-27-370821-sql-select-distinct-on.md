In SQL, the `SELECT DISTINCT` clause is used to retrieve unique values from a specific column or a combination of columns in a table. However, sometimes you may need to retrieve distinct values based on a specific column or a group of columns, where the first occurrence of each unique value is returned. This is where the `SELECT DISTINCT ON` clause comes into play.

## Syntax

The syntax for using `SELECT DISTINCT ON` in SQL is as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (column_name)
    column_name1, column_name2, ...
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name, ...
```

Here, the `column_name` represents the column or group of columns that you want to consider for uniqueness, and `column_name1, column_name2, ...` represents the columns you want to retrieve the values from.

## Example Usage

Let's consider a table `employees` with the following data:

| employee_id | first_name  | last_name | department |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| 1           | John        | Doe       | Sales      |
| 2           | Jane        | Smith     | Marketing  |
| 3           | John        | Smith     | Sales      |
| 4           | Jane        | Doe       | Marketing  |

If we want to retrieve the distinct values of the `first_name` column, considering only the first occurrence of each unique name, we can use the `SELECT DISTINCT ON` clause as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT ON (first_name)
    first_name, last_name
FROM employees
ORDER BY first_name, employee_id;
```

This query will return the following result:

| first_name | last_name |
|------------|-----------|
| John       | Doe       |
| Jane       | Smith     |

In this example, the `SELECT DISTINCT ON` clause considers the `first_name` column for uniqueness and retrieves the `last_name` column along with it. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to determine which occurrence of each unique value should be considered.

## Conclusion

The `SELECT DISTINCT ON` clause in SQL allows you to retrieve distinct values based on a specific column or group of columns, considering only the first occurrence of each unique value. This can be useful when you need to analyze or manipulate data with specific criteria in mind. Remember to include the appropriate `ORDER BY` clause to determine the first occurrence of each unique value. #SQL #SELECT #DISTINCT
