In SQL, the **SELECT** statement is commonly used to retrieve data from a database table. One common use case is filtering for **NULL** values. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the **SELECT** statement to filter for **NULL** values in a SQL database.

Let's say we have a table called **employees** with the following columns: **id**, **name**, and **email**. We want to retrieve all employees whose email address is **NULL**.

To perform this task, we can use the **IS NULL** operator in conjunction with the **SELECT** statement. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM employees 
WHERE email IS NULL;
```

In this query, we are selecting all columns from the **employees** table where the **email** column is **NULL**. The **IS NULL** operator checks if a given value is **NULL**. 

The result of this query will be a list of employees who do not have an email address associated with them.

It's important to note that the **IS NULL** operator can only be used with **NULL** values. If you want to check for non-**NULL** values, you can use the **IS NOT NULL** operator instead.

In summary, the **SELECT** statement in SQL provides a powerful way to filter for **NULL** values in a database table. By using the **IS NULL** operator, you can easily retrieve records that have **NULL** values in a specific column.
