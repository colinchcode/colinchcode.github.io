One of the most common queries in SQL is to retrieve the maximum value from a column. The `SELECT MAX` statement allows you to easily find the highest value in a specific column of a table. Let's explore how to use this statement effectively.

## Syntax

The syntax for using `SELECT MAX` is straightforward:

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

Here, `column_name` refers to the specific column from which you want to retrieve the maximum value, and `table_name` is the name of the table in which the column resides.

## Example

Suppose we have a table called `employees` with the following structure:

| emp_id | emp_name | salary |
|--------|----------|--------|
| 1      | John     | 5000   |
| 2      | Jane     | 6000   |
| 3      | Lisa     | 4500   |
| 4      | Mark     | 7000   |
| 5      | Amy      | 5500   |

To find the highest salary from the `salary` column, we can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary)
FROM employees;
```

The result of this query would be `7000`, as it retrieves the maximum value from the `salary` column.

## Conclusion

The `SELECT MAX` statement is a powerful tool that allows you to easily retrieve the maximum value from a specific column in a table. By using this statement, you can quickly find the highest value without the need for complex calculations or sorting. #SQL #SELECTMAX
