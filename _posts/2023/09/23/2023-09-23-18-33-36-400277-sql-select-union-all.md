In SQL, the `UNION ALL` operation is used to combine the results of two or more `SELECT` statements into a single result set. Unlike the `UNION` operator, which removes duplicate rows, `UNION ALL` retains all rows from each SELECT statement, resulting in a larger result set.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for using `UNION ALL` is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table2
```

Each `SELECT` statement must have the same number of columns with compatible data types.

## Example

Let's consider a simple example where we have two tables, `customers` and `employees`, that store information about company personnel. We want to combine the data from both tables to get a comprehensive list of all individuals associated with the company.

```sql
SELECT full_name, email FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT full_name, email FROM employees;
```

In this example, we have specified the `full_name` and `email` columns from both the `customers` and `employees` tables. The `UNION ALL` operation will merge the results from both tables, preserving duplicate rows.

## Use Cases

The `UNION ALL` operation is commonly used in scenarios where you need to combine data from multiple tables or queries. Some common use cases include:

- Consolidating information from multiple tables into a single report or result set.
- Combining similar data from different sources or databases.
- Merging data from temporary or staging tables before further processing.

It's important to note that `UNION ALL` does not perform any sorting or filtering. To sort or eliminate duplicate rows from the result set, you can use the `ORDER BY` and `DISTINCT` keywords respectively.

## Conclusion

The `UNION ALL` operation is a powerful feature in SQL that allows you to combine the results of multiple `SELECT` statements. It retains all rows from each query, making it useful for scenarios where you need to simply merge data without considering duplicates. By utilizing `UNION ALL`, you can efficiently consolidate and analyze data from various sources in your SQL queries.
