When working with SQL, the `SELECT MIN` statement allows you to retrieve the minimum value from a column in a table. However, there may be situations where you need to perform more complex calculations or retrieve the minimum value from a subset of data. In such cases, you can use nested SELECT statements to accomplish your task.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for using nested SELECT statements with `SELECT MIN` is as follows:

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name)
FROM (SELECT ...)
```

The inner `SELECT` statement (the subquery) can contain any valid SQL statement, such as filtering, joining, or aggregating data. The outer `SELECT` statement then applies the `MIN` function to the result of the subquery and returns the minimum value.

## Example

Let's say we have a table called `products` with the following columns: `id`, `name`, and `price`. We want to find the minimum price among products whose name starts with the letter "A". Here's how you can achieve it using nested SELECT statements:

```sql
SELECT MIN(price)
FROM (SELECT price
      FROM products
      WHERE name LIKE 'A%') AS subquery
```

In the example above, the inner `SELECT` statement filters the products based on the name starting with "A" using the `WHERE` clause. The outer `SELECT` statement then applies the `MIN` function to the `price` column of the filtered result set.

It's important to note that the nested SELECT statement is aliased as `subquery`. This is necessary because the outer `SELECT` statement treats the result of the subquery as a derived table with the alias `subquery`.

## Conclusion

Using nested SELECT statements with the `SELECT MIN` function expands your ability to perform complex calculations or retrieve minimum values from subsets of data within your SQL queries. By nesting the `SELECT` statements, you have fine-grained control over the data manipulations, allowing you to achieve the desired results efficiently and effectively.
