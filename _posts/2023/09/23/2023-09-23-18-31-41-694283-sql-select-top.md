In SQL, the `SELECT` statement is used to query a database table and return a result set based on specified conditions. The `TOP` clause is used to limit the number of rows returned by a `SELECT` statement.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of the `SELECT` statement with the `TOP` clause is as follows:

```sql
SELECT TOP expression column1, column2, ...
FROM table
WHERE condition;
```

Here, `expression` represents the number of rows to be returned.

## Example

Suppose we have a table called `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, `age`, and `salary`. We want to retrieve the top 5 employees based on their salary. Here's how we can do it:

```sql
SELECT TOP 5 name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

In the above example, the `TOP 5` clause specifies that we want to retrieve only the top 5 records. The `ORDER BY salary DESC` clause sorts the records in descending order based on the `salary` column.

## Conclusion

The `SELECT TOP` clause is a powerful feature in SQL that allows you to limit the number of rows returned by a `SELECT` statement. It is useful when you only need a certain number of records from a large result set. By using the `TOP` clause, you can efficiently retrieve the required data from a database table.
