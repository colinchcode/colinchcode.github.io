The `LIMIT` clause is commonly used in SQL SELECT statements to restrict the number of rows returned from a query. It allows you to specify the maximum number of rows to be displayed in the result set.

## Syntax

The syntax for using the `LIMIT` clause in SQL is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT number_of_rows;
```

The `table_name` is the name of the table from which you want to fetch the data. `column1, column2, ...` represents the columns you want to retrieve. The `number_of_rows` specifies the maximum number of rows to be returned.

## Example

Consider a table `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`. We can use the `LIMIT` clause to retrieve a subset of records as follows:

```sql
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees
LIMIT 10;
```

The above query selects the first 10 rows from the `employees` table and returns only the `id`, `name`, and `salary` columns.

## Pagination

The `LIMIT` clause is often used in conjunction with other keywords like `OFFSET` to implement pagination. This allows you to retrieve a specific range of rows from a result set.

To fetch records starting from a specific offset, you can use the `OFFSET` keyword. For example, to retrieve the 11th to 20th rows in the `employees` table, you can use:

```sql
SELECT id, name, salary
FROM employees
LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10;
```

This query skips the first 10 rows and then returns the next 10 rows from the `employees` table.

## Conclusion

The `LIMIT` clause is a powerful tool in SQL statements that allows you to control the number of rows returned. By using it wisely in your SELECT statements, you can efficiently manage the amount of data retrieved and implement pagination in your applications.
