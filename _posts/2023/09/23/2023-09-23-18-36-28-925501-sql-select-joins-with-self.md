In SQL, you can use self-joins to combine rows from a single table based on a related reference within the table itself. This technique allows you to query hierarchical or nested data structures present in a single table. Self-joins are particularly useful when dealing with data that has a parent-child relationship.

Let's say you have a table called `employees` with the following columns: `employee_id`, `name`, and `manager_id`. The `manager_id` column represents the employee's manager, where the value corresponds to the `employee_id` of the manager in the same table.

To perform a self-join, you need to join the table with itself using aliases for each occurrence. Here's an example of a self-join query to retrieve the employees and their managers:

```sql
SELECT 
    e.name AS employee_name,
    m.name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```

In the query above, we alias the `employees` table as `e` for the employee rows and as `m` for the manager rows. We then join the table on the condition where the `manager_id` in the `e` alias matches the `employee_id` in the `m` alias. By specifying different aliases, we can differentiate between the employee and manager rows.

This query will return a result set with the employee names and their corresponding manager names.

You can also perform more complex self-joins to query deeper hierarchical relationships. For example, if you have a multi-level management structure, you can chain multiple self-joins to retrieve information at different levels.

Self-joins are powerful tools when working with hierarchical data structures in SQL. They enable you to retrieve valuable information by referencing relationships within the same table. Utilize self-joins efficiently to gain insights into your data and perform deeper analysis.
