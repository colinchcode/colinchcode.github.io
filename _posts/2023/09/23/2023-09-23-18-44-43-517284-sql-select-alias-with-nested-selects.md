In SQL, we can use aliases to assign temporary names to columns or tables in our queries. This can be useful when working with nested SELECT statements, which involve subqueries or derived tables. Using aliases can make our queries more readable and concise.

Let's say we have two tables: `Customers` and `Orders`. The `Orders` table has a foreign key relationship with the `Customers` table. We want to retrieve all customers along with their total number of orders. Here's an example of how we can achieve this using nested SELECT statements and aliases:

```sql
SELECT c.CustomerName, o.TotalOrders
FROM Customers c
JOIN (
    SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders
    FROM Orders
    GROUP BY CustomerID
) o ON c.CustomerID = o.CustomerID;
```

In the above query, we have created a nested SELECT statement to calculate the total number of orders for each customer. The inner SELECT statement retrieves the `CustomerID` and uses the `COUNT(*)` function to count the number of orders for each customer. We have included an alias `TotalOrders` to give a meaningful name to this calculated column.

The outer SELECT statement then retrieves the `CustomerName` from the `Customers` table and joins it with the inner result set based on the `CustomerID` column. By using the aliases `c` and `o` for the tables and the derived table respectively, we make the query more readable.

In conclusion, using aliases in SQL SELECT statements with nested SELECTs can improve the clarity and readability of our queries. This not only helps us understand the query better but also makes it easier for others to interpret our code.
