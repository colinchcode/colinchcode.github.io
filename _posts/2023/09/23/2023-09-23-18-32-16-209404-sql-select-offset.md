The syntax for using `OFFSET` in a `SELECT` statement is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
OFFSET offset_value
```

Here, `column1, column2, ...` represents the columns you want to retrieve from the table, and `table_name` is the name of the table from which you want to select data. `offset_value` specifies the number of rows to skip before starting the output.

For example, let's say you have a table called `users` with columns `id`, `name`, and `email`. To retrieve all users starting from the 10th row, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
OFFSET 10;
```

This query will skip the first 10 rows in the `users` table and retrieve the remaining rows.

It's important to note that the `OFFSET` clause works in conjunction with the `LIMIT` clause to control the number of rows returned. If you only specify `OFFSET`, it will skip the specified number of rows and return all remaining rows. If you also want to limit the number of rows returned, you can add the `LIMIT` clause after the `OFFSET` clause.

For example, to retrieve 10 rows starting from the 20th row, you can modify the query as follows:

```sql
SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
OFFSET 20
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will skip the first 20 rows and return the next 10 rows from the `users` table.

Using the `OFFSET` clause in SQL SELECT statements provides flexibility in fetching data from specific rows onwards, which can be incredibly beneficial when dealing with large datasets or implementing pagination in web applications.
