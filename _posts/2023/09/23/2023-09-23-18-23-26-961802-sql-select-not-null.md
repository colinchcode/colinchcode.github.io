In SQL, the `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. Often, you may need to filter the results to include only the rows that have non-null values in a specific column. This can be achieved using the `IS NOT NULL` condition in your `SELECT` query.

Here's an example to demonstrate how to use the `IS NOT NULL` condition:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM your_table 
WHERE column1 IS NOT NULL;
```

In this example, `your_table` is the name of the table you want to query, `column1` and `column2` are the columns you want to select from, and `IS NOT NULL` ensures that only rows with non-null values in `column1` are returned in the result set.

You can also use the `IS NULL` condition to select rows that have null values in a specific column. Here's an example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 
FROM your_table 
WHERE column1 IS NULL;
```

In this case, only the rows with null values in `column1` will be included in the result.

By using the `IS NOT NULL` and `IS NULL` conditions in your `SELECT` queries, you can effectively filter and retrieve the data based on the presence or absence of null values in a specific column.
