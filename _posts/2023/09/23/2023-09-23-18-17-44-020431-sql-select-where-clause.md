The `SELECT` statement in SQL is used to retrieve data from a database table. To further refine your query and retrieve more specific results, you can use the `WHERE` clause. The `WHERE` clause allows you to filter data based on specified conditions.

## Syntax
The basic syntax of the `SELECT` statement with the `WHERE` clause is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Here, `column1, column2, ...` represents the columns that you want to retrieve from the table, `table_name` is the name of the table from which data is retrieved, and `condition` is the filter criteria.

## Examples

### Example 1: Retrieving specific rows from a table

Suppose we have a table named `users` with columns `id`, `name`, `age`, and `country`. To retrieve all rows where the `age` is greater than 30, the SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age > 30;
```
This query will return all rows from the `users` table where the `age` column has a value greater than 30.

### Example 2: Using multiple conditions

In some cases, you may want to use multiple conditions to filter data. For instance, let's say you want to retrieve all rows where the `age` is greater than 30 and the `country` is 'USA'. The SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE age > 30 AND country = 'USA';
```
This query will return all rows where the `age` is greater than 30 and the `country` is 'USA'.

### Example 3: Using wildcard characters

You can also use wildcard characters like `%` and `_` in the `WHERE` clause to perform pattern matching. For instance, to retrieve all rows where the `name` starts with 'J', the SQL query would be:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
```

This query will return all rows where the `name` column starts with the letter 'J'.

## Conclusion

The `WHERE` clause in the SQL `SELECT` statement allows you to filter and retrieve specific data from a database table based on the specified conditions. By using the `WHERE` clause effectively, you can narrow down the results and extract the data you need for your application.
