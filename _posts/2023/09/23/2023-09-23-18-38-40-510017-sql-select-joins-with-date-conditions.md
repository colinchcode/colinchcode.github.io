When working with SQL databases, it is common to use JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables. Sometimes, you may need to join tables based on date conditions. In this blog post, we will explore how to perform SQL SELECT joins with date conditions.

## Understanding SQL JOINs

Before diving into the specifics of using date conditions in joins, let's briefly recap the different types of SQL JOINs:

1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns only the matching rows from both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all the rows from the left table and the matching rows from the right table.
3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all the rows from the right table and the matching rows from the left table.
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Returns all the rows from both tables, regardless of whether they have a match or not.

## SQL SELECT JOIN with Date Conditions

To perform a JOIN with date conditions, you need to compare dates in the ON clause of the JOIN statement. Let's see an example using the **INNER JOIN**.

Assume we have two tables: `orders` and `customers`. The `orders` table contains information about customer orders, including the `order_date`, and the `customers` table contains information about customers, including the `customer_id`. We want to retrieve all orders placed by customers who joined in the last 3 months.

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 3 MONTH);
```

In this example, we are selecting the `order_id`, `order_date`, and `customer_name` columns from the joined tables. The ON clause specifies that we want to match `customer_id` from the `orders` table with the `customer_id` from the `customers` table. The WHERE clause filters the result to include only orders placed within the last 3 months.

## Conclusion

Performing SQL SELECT joins with date conditions allows you to combine data from multiple tables based on time-related criteria. Whether you need to filter orders by date range or join tables based on specific date values, understanding how to use date conditions in JOINs is an essential skill for working with SQL databases.
