The syntax for a RIGHT JOIN is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

Let's take a closer look at an example. Suppose we have two tables: `customers` and `orders`. The `customers` table stores information about customers, and the `orders` table contains details about orders made by customers. We want to retrieve all orders, along with the customer information if applicable.

Here's an example query using a RIGHT JOIN:

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, customers.customer_name, orders.order_date
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;
```

In this query, we are retrieving the `order_id`, `customer_name`, and `order_date` from the `orders` table and the `customer_name` from the `customers` table. The RIGHT JOIN ensures that all records from the `orders` table are included, even if there is no matching customer in the `customers` table.

Remember to adjust the column names and table names in the query to match your own database schema.

By using a RIGHT JOIN, you can easily fetch records from the right table that may not have a match in the left table, allowing you to analyze data in a more comprehensive manner.
