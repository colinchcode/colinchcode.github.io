When working with databases, it is common to have multiple tables containing related information. In such cases, we often need to combine the data from different tables into a single result set. SQL provides various types of JOIN operations to accomplish this, with the **INNER JOIN** being the most widely used.

The INNER JOIN allows us to select records from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It returns only the rows where the specified column values match in both tables.

## Syntax

The basic syntax for an **INNER JOIN** in SQL is as follows:

```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2 
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

- `table1` and `table2` are the names of the tables you want to join.
- `column1` and `column2` are the columns you want to select from each table.
- `ON table1.column = table2.column` specifies the condition for joining the tables.

## Example

Let's consider a simple example to demonstrate the usage of INNER JOIN. Suppose we have two tables `customers` and `orders` with the following structure and records:

**customers:**

| id  | name     | email                |
| --- | -------- | -------------------- |
| 1   | John Doe | john@example.com     |
| 2   | Jane Lee | jane@example.com     |
| 3   | Alex Tan | alex@example.com     |

**orders:**

| id  | customer_id | product      | quantity |
| --- | ----------- | ------------ | -------- |
| 1   | 1           | Smartphone   | 2        |
| 2   | 2           | Laptop       | 1        |
| 3   | 2           | Headphones   | 3        |
| 4   | 3           | Smartwatch   | 1        |

To retrieve a result set containing the customer's name and their corresponding order details, we would use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT customers.name, orders.product, orders.quantity
FROM customers
INNER JOIN orders
ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;
```

This query will merge the `customers` and `orders` tables based on the matching `customer_id` and `id` columns. The result will be:

| name     | product     | quantity |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| John Doe | Smartphone  | 2        |
| Jane Lee | Laptop      | 1        |
| Jane Lee | Headphones  | 3        |
| Alex Tan | Smartwatch  | 1        |

## Conclusion

By using the INNER JOIN operation in SQL, we can combine data from multiple tables based on a common column. It allows us to retrieve information that is spread across different tables in a single result set. Understanding how to use INNER JOIN is essential for anyone working with relational databases.
