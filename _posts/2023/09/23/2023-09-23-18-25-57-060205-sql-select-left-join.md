In SQL, the **LEFT JOIN** operation is used to retrieve data from multiple tables. It allows you to combine rows from the left table with the matching rows from the right table, and includes all the rows from the left table, even if there is no match in the right table.

To perform a **LEFT JOIN**, you need to specify the tables you want to join and the join condition using the `JOIN` and `ON` keywords. Here's a basic syntax example:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column
```

Let's break down this syntax:

- `SELECT`: specifies the columns you want to retrieve from the tables.
- `FROM`: specifies the main table you want to query data from (in this case, `table1`).
- `LEFT JOIN`: specifies the type of join you want to perform.
- `table2`: specifies the second table you want to join with `table1`.
- `ON`: defines the join condition, which is used to match rows between the two tables.

After executing the **LEFT JOIN** query, the result will include all the rows from `table1`, regardless of whether there is a matching row in `table2`. If there is no matching row in `table2`, the columns from `table2` will contain `NULL` values in the result set.

Let's consider an example to better understand the concept. Suppose we have two tables: `customers` and `orders`. The `customers` table contains information about customers, and the `orders` table contains information about their orders.

Here's a query that uses a **LEFT JOIN** to retrieve all customers along with their respective order information (if available):

```sql
SELECT customers.customer_id, customers.name, orders.order_id, orders.order_date
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN orders
ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
```

In this example, the query will return all customers, even if they haven't placed any orders. The result set will include the customer details and their respective order details (if available), or `NULL` values in case of no matching orders.

That's how you can perform a **LEFT JOIN** in SQL to combine data from multiple tables. It's a powerful operation that allows you to retrieve comprehensive data for analysis or reporting purposes.
