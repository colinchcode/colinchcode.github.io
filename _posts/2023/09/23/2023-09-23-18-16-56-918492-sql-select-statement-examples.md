In this blog post, we will cover some common examples of SQL SELECT statements that you can use to retrieve data from a database. The SELECT statement is one of the most fundamental and powerful statements in SQL, allowing you to query and extract specific information from your database tables.

## 1. Select all columns from a table

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name;
```
This query will retrieve all the columns and records from the specified table.

## 2. Select specific columns from a table

```sql
SELECT column_name1, column_name2 FROM table_name;
```
Replace `column_name1` and `column_name2` with the names of the columns you want to select. This query will retrieve only the specified columns from the table.

## 3. Select distinct values

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;
```
This query will return only distinct values of the specified column, removing duplicates.

## 4. Select with conditions

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
Replace `condition` with the desired logical condition. This query will retrieve only the records that satisfy the given condition.

## 5. Select with sorting

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC/DESC;
```
Replace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to sort by. Use `ASC` for ascending order or `DESC` for descending order. This query will retrieve all records from the table and sort them based on the specified column.

## 6. Select with limiting results

```sql
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number_of_rows;
```
Replace `number_of_rows` with the desired number of rows you want to retrieve. This query will retrieve only the specified number of rows from the table.

These are just a few examples of SQL SELECT statements that you can use to query and retrieve data from your database. The SELECT statement provides a lot of flexibility and power in retrieving data, allowing you to extract the information you need for your applications or analysis.
