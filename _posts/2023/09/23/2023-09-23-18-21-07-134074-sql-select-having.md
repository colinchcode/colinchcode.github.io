In SQL, the `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. It allows you to specify which columns you want to select and filter the rows based on specified conditions.

The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to filter the results of a query based on a specified condition. It is typically used to filter the aggregated data in a `GROUP BY` query.

The syntax for using the `HAVING` clause in a `SELECT` statement is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2, ...
HAVING condition;
```

Here, `column1`, `column2`, etc., are the columns you want to retrieve data from, and `table_name` is the name of the table you want to query.

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the data based on one or more specified columns. It is required when using the `HAVING` clause.

The `HAVING` condition is applied to the grouped data, and only the groups that satisfy the condition are included in the result set.

Let's look at an example to better understand how to use the `HAVING` clause:

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

In this example, we are retrieving the `department` column and the count of employees in each department from the `employees` table. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data by the `department` column, and the `HAVING` clause filters out the departments that have more than 5 employees.

You can add additional conditions to the `HAVING` clause using logical operators such as `AND` or `OR` to further filter the results based on your requirements.

Using the `HAVING` clause allows you to perform more advanced filtering on aggregated data in SQL, providing more flexibility in retrieving the desired results.
