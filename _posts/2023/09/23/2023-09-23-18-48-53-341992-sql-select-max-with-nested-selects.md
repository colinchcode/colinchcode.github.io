In SQL, the `SELECT MAX()` function allows you to retrieve the maximum value from a specific column in a table. However, there might be scenarios where you need to use nested SELECT statements to find the maximum value based on certain conditions or in combination with other queries. Let's explore how to achieve this.

## Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for using `SELECT MAX()` is as follows:

```sql
SELECT MAX(column_name)
FROM table_name;
```

This will return the maximum value of the specified `column_name` from the `table_name`.

## Example: Finding the Maximum Salary

Consider a scenario where you have an "Employees" table with columns such as "EmployeeID", "EmployeeName", and "Salary". To find the employee with the highest salary, you can use a nested SELECT statement in conjunction with `SELECT MAX()`.

```sql
SELECT EmployeeID, EmployeeName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary = (
    SELECT MAX(Salary)
    FROM Employees
);
```

This query will return the details of the employee(s) with the maximum salary from the "Employees" table.

## Example: Finding the Maximum Order Amount for Each Customer

In another scenario, imagine you have an "Orders" table that contains columns such as "OrderID", "CustomerID", and "OrderAmount". You want to find the maximum order amount for each customer. This can be accomplished with a nested SELECT statement and the GROUP BY clause.

```sql
SELECT CustomerID, MAX(OrderAmount) AS MaxOrderAmount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID;
```

This query will return the customer ID along with their maximum order amount from the "Orders" table, grouped by the customer ID.

## Conclusion

Using nested SELECT statements can be helpful when you need to retrieve the maximum value from a specific column in a table based on certain conditions or in combination with other queries. By leveraging the capabilities of SQL, you can easily perform complex data analysis and retrieval tasks efficiently.
