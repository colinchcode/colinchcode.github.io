In SQL, **joins** allow us to combine data from different tables based on a common column. One useful technique when performing joins is to use **table aliases**. Table aliases provide a shorthand way to reference a table in a query, making it easier to read and write complex SQL statements.

Here is an example of using aliases in a SELECT statement with join in SQL:

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, c.customer_name, p.product_name
FROM orders AS o
JOIN customers AS c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products AS p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
```

In the above example, we use aliases 'o', 'c', and 'p' for the tables `orders`, `customers`, and `products`, respectively. 

By using aliases, we can refer to the columns in each table by the alias followed by a dot notation (`alias.column_name`). This way, we avoid ambiguity in column names and make the query more readable.

The `AS` keyword is optional and allows us to assign aliases to the tables. If the `AS` keyword is omitted, the aliases can still be defined directly after the table name.

When using aliases, it's important to note that they are scoped to the query in which they are used. If we have subqueries or nested joins, we can use different aliases for the same table name without conflict.

Using aliases in joins can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of SQL queries, especially when working with large and complex databases. It also helps in avoiding repetitive table names and makes the code more concise.
