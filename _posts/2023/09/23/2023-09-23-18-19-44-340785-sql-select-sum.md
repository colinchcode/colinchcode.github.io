When working with databases, it is common to perform calculations on the data. One of the most frequently used calculations is the sum operation. In SQL, the `SUM` function allows you to calculate the sum of values in a column.

To perform the sum operation in a SQL SELECT statement, follow these steps:

1. Start by writing the SELECT statement to retrieve the desired data from the table.
2. Use the `SUM` function to calculate the sum of values in the specified column.
3. Specify the column name or expression inside the `SUM` function.
4. Give an alias to the calculated sum using the `AS` keyword followed by the desired alias name.

Here is an example to illustrate the usage of `SUM` in a SQL SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM orders;
```

In the example above, we are calculating the total quantity of items ordered from the `orders` table. The `quantity` column holds the quantity of each item in an order. By using the `SUM` function and providing the `quantity` column as the argument, we can retrieve the total sum of all quantities. The calculated sum is given the alias `total_quantity` using the `AS` keyword.

By running this SQL query, you will get the total sum of quantities as a result.

Remember to replace `quantity` and `orders` with the actual column name and table name in your database.

Using the `SUM` function in SQL SELECT statements is a powerful way to calculate totals and perform aggregations on your data. It can be used in combination with other functions, such as `GROUP BY`, to perform more complex calculations and analysis.
