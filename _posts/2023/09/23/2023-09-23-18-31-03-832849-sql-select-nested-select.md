Nested SELECT queries are useful when you need to retrieve data from multiple tables or filter data based on certain conditions. They allow you to create more complex queries and retrieve specific information from your database.

To illustrate how a nested SELECT query works, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have two tables: `users` and `orders`. The `users` table contains information about users, such as their `id` and `name`. The `orders` table contains information about orders, such as the `order_id`, `user_id`, and `amount`.

Now, let's say we want to retrieve the names of the users who have placed orders with an amount greater than $100. We can achieve this using a nested SELECT query. Here's an example of how the SQL query would look like:

```sql
SELECT name
FROM users
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT user_id
    FROM orders
    WHERE amount > 100
);
```

In the above query, the nested SELECT statement `(SELECT user_id FROM orders WHERE amount > 100)` retrieves the `user_id` from the `orders` table for all orders with an amount greater than $100. The outer SELECT statement then retrieves the corresponding `name` from the `users` table for those `user_id` values.

By using a nested SELECT, we are able to filter the data in the `orders` table based on the specified condition and retrieve the desired information from the `users` table.

Nested SELECT queries can be powerful tools when it comes to retrieving data from SQL databases. They allow you to combine multiple conditions and tables together, providing you with the flexibility to get the exact information you need.

Next time you encounter a scenario that requires complex data retrieval, consider using a nested SELECT query to handle it efficiently.
