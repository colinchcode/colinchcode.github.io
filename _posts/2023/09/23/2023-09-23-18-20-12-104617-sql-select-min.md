When working with relational databases, it is often necessary to retrieve the minimum value from a specific column. This can be accomplished using the `SELECT` statement in SQL.

To find the minimum value in a column, follow these steps:

1. Start by using the `SELECT` statement.
2. Specify the column from which you want to find the minimum value using the `MIN()` function.
3. Provide the table name from which you want to retrieve the data.

Here is an example code snippet in SQL for finding the minimum value:

```sql
SELECT MIN(column_name) FROM table_name;
```

Replace `column_name` with the name of the column from which you want to find the minimum value and `table_name` with the name of the table where the column resides.

For instance, suppose you have a table named "Employees" with a column called "Salary". To find the minimum salary from the "Salary" column, you would use the following code:

```sql
SELECT MIN(Salary) FROM Employees;
```

This query will return the minimum salary value from the "Salary" column in the "Employees" table.

By utilizing the `MIN()` function along with the `SELECT` statement, you can easily retrieve the minimum value from a specific column in SQL.
