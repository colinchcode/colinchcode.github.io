To use the SQL SELECT COUNT statement, you need to specify the table name and the condition for which you want to count the rows. Here is the basic syntax:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

Let's break down the statement:

- `COUNT(*)`: This is the function that counts the number of rows. The asterisk (*) is a wildcard that represents all columns in the table. You can also specify a specific column name instead of the asterisk if you want to count the non-null values in that particular column.

- `FROM table_name`: This specifies the table from which you want to retrieve the data.

- `WHERE condition`: This is an optional part of the statement that lets you specify a condition to filter the rows. If you omit the WHERE clause, the COUNT function will return the total number of rows in the table.

To illustrate this with an example, let's say we have a table called "employees" with columns like "id", "name", "department", and "salary", and we want to count the number of employees who belong to the "Marketing" department:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department = 'Marketing';
```

In this case, the query will return the count of all the rows in the "employees" table where the "department" column matches the condition "Marketing".

Using the SELECT COUNT statement is a straightforward and efficient way to retrieve the count of rows that meet specific criteria in a SQL database. It allows you to gain insights into your data and make informed decisions based on the information retrieved.
