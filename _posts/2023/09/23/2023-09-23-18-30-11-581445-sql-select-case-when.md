```sql
SELECT column1, column2, 
  CASE 
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    ELSE result3
  END AS new_column
FROM your_table;
```
In this example, `column1` and `column2` are the columns you want to select from the table `your_table`. The `CASE WHEN` statement begins with the `CASE` keyword followed by multiple `WHEN` conditions. If `condition1` is true, `result1` will be returned for the new column `new_column`. If `condition2` is true, `result2` will be returned. If none of the conditions are met, `result3` will be returned.

You can customize the conditions and results based on your specific requirements. The `AS` keyword is used to assign an alias to the new column, which is optional.
