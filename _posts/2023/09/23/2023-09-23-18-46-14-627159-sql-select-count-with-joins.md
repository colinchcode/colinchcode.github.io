When working with SQL databases, there may be times when you need to retrieve the count of records based on a specific condition that involves multiple tables. In such cases, you can make use of the `JOIN` clause in combination with the `COUNT` function to achieve the desired result.

Here's an example of how you can use `JOIN` and `COUNT` together to get the count of records from multiple tables:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM table1
JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.table1_id
WHERE table2.column_name = 'condition';
```

Let's break down the above SQL query:

- We start with the `SELECT COUNT(*)` statement, where `*` represents all columns. You can specify specific columns if needed.

- Next, we use the `JOIN` clause to combine the `table1` and `table2` based on the `id` and `table1_id` columns, respectively. This allows us to fetch the necessary data from both tables.

- After the `JOIN`, we add the `WHERE` clause to specify the condition for filtering the records. In the example above, `table2.column_name = 'condition'` represents an example condition that you can replace with your own.

- Finally, we alias the `COUNT(*)` result as `total_records` using `AS`, which allows us to refer to the count with a more meaningful name in the result set.

By using this approach, you can easily count records from multiple tables while considering specific conditions using the `JOIN` and `COUNT` functions in SQL.
