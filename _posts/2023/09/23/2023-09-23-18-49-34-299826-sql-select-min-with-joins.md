When working with SQL, you may come across situations where you need to retrieve the minimum value from a column in a table, using joins to combine the data from multiple tables. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `MIN` function in conjunction with joins to accomplish this task.

To illustrate this, let's consider a scenario where we have two tables: `orders` and `customers`. The `orders` table contains information about orders placed by customers, while the `customers` table contains the details of the customers. The two tables are related by the `customer_id` column.

## Query using SQL JOIN and MIN

To find the minimum order amount for each customer, we can use the `JOIN` clause to combine the `orders` and `customers` tables based on the `customer_id` column, and then use the `MIN` function to retrieve the minimum order amount.

```sql
SELECT customers.customer_name, MIN(orders.order_amount) AS min_order_amount
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id
GROUP BY customers.customer_name;
```

In the above query, we select the `customer_name` column from the `customers` table, and calculate the minimum of the `order_amount` column from the `orders` table using the `MIN` function. By grouping the result by `customer_name`, we ensure that we get the minimum order amount per customer.

## Conclusion

Using the `MIN` function in combination with SQL joins allows us to find the minimum value from a column in a table that is related to another table. By leveraging the power of SQL, we can easily obtain valuable insights from our data. This technique can be applied to a variety of scenarios where finding the minimum value across tables is required.

Keep exploring SQL functions and join statements to unlock the full potential of data manipulation and analysis. Happy SQL coding!
