In data federation scenarios, where data is distributed across multiple systems and databases, managing updates to dimension tables can be challenging. Dimension tables provide important context and reference data for analyzing and interpreting the measures in a data warehouse or data mart. It is crucial to ensure that these tables remain up to date and accurate for effective analysis and reporting.

## The Challenge

When dimension tables are stored in separate systems or databases that are part of a data federation architecture, updating them requires careful consideration. Unlike fact tables that typically store transactional data and can be updated directly, dimension tables contain descriptive attributes that provide context to the measures. These attributes are used for slicing, filtering, and aggregating the data.

The challenge arises when there is a need to update the values of these attributes in dimension tables. The updates must be applied consistently across all the systems that use the dimension tables, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

## Approaches for Handling Dimension Table Updates

### 1. Centralized Update Approach

In this approach, a centralized data integration or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process is used to update the dimension tables. The process involves extracting the updated data from the source systems, transforming it to match the dimension table structure, and loading it into the centralized data warehouse or data mart.

**Pros:**
- Ensures consistency across all systems that use the dimension tables.
- Simplifies the update process by centralizing it.
- Allows for data validation and cleansing during the transformation phase.

**Cons:**
- May introduce latency in data availability due to the ETL process.
- Requires additional infrastructure and resources for the centralized update process.

### 2. Distributed Update Approach

In this approach, updates to the dimension tables are performed directly on the respective source systems or databases where the tables are stored. This approach requires careful coordination and synchronization across all the systems to maintain consistency.

**Pros:**
- Immediate availability of updated data without latency.
- Updates can be performed directly on the source systems, reducing the need for additional infrastructure.

**Cons:**
- Requires complex coordination and synchronization mechanisms across systems.
- Increases the risk of inconsistency if updates are not properly synchronized.
- May lead to longer update times if the changes need to propagate to multiple systems.

## Best Practices for Dimension Table Updates

To handle dimension table updates effectively in data federation scenarios, consider the following best practices:

1. **Establish a clear data governance framework**: Define data ownership, access controls, and update policies to ensure accountability and consistency in updating dimension tables.

2. **Use proper data synchronization mechanisms**: Implement robust data synchronization techniques to ensure updates are applied consistently across systems. This can include techniques like Change Data Capture (CDC) or triggers to capture and propagate updates.

3. **Regularly monitor and validate updates**: Develop monitoring processes to identify inconsistencies or data quality issues that may arise during dimension table updates. Regularly validate the updated data to ensure accuracy and integrity.

4. **Consider data versioning**: If updates to the dimension table require historical tracking of attribute changes, consider implementing data versioning techniques to maintain a historical record of changes.
