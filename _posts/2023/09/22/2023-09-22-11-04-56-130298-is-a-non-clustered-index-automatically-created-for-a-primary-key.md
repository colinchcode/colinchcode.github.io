A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table and ensures data integrity and uniqueness. It is typically implemented as a clustered index, which determines the physical order of data in the table. The clustered index provides fast retrieval of data in the order of the index key.

On the other hand, a non-clustered index is a separate structure that contains a copy of the indexed data columns along with a pointer to the corresponding row in the table. It allows for quicker retrieval of data based on the indexed columns, but it does not affect the physical order of the data in the table.

Although a primary key is not automatically indexed with a non-clustered index, it is often beneficial to create one. This is particularly useful when you need to frequently search or join tables based on the primary key column. The non-clustered index on the primary key can improve query performance significantly.

To create a non-clustered index on the primary key column, you can use the index creation syntax specific to your database management system. For example, in Microsoft SQL Server, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_Name ON TableName (PrimaryKeyColumn);
```

Remember to replace `idx_Name` with a meaningful name for the index and `TableName` with the actual table name.

By manually creating a non-clustered index on the primary key column, you can optimize query performance and improve the overall efficiency of your database operations.
