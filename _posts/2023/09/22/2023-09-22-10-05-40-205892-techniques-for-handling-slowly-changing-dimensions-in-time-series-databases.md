As time series databases become more widely used, the need to handle slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) within these databases becomes crucial. SCDs refer to the dimensions that change slowly over time, such as customer profiles, product attributes, or geographical locations. Managing SCDs effectively is important for maintaining data accuracy and making meaningful analyses. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques for handling SCDs in time series databases.

## 1. Type 1: Overwriting Existing Data

The Type 1 approach is the simplest technique for handling SCDs. In this method, the old dimension data is overwritten with the updated values. This means that once a dimension value changes, it is immediately reflected in the database. Although this approach is straightforward, it has its limitations.

### Pros of Type 1:
- Simplicity: Overwriting data requires minimal effort and complexity.
- Data Size: The database size remains constant as there are no additional versions of the dimension data.

### Cons of Type 1:
- Historical Analysis: Since old dimensions are overwritten, historical analysis based on previous values is not possible.
- Audit Trail: The changes made to the dimension are not audited, making it difficult to track the evolution of the data over time.

## 2. Type 2: Creating New Records

The Type 2 approach is more comprehensive and allows for historical analysis of dimension data. In this technique, a new record is created whenever there is a change in the dimension value. The new record contains the updated dimension value, along with effective dates or version numbers to indicate when the value is valid. This allows for a complete historical view of the dimension data.

### Pros of Type 2:
- Historical Analysis: With separate records for each change, historical analysis becomes possible. It enables comparisons of different versions of dimension values over time.
- Audit Trail: The creation of new records provides an audit trail of all changes made to the dimension.

### Cons of Type 2:
- Data Size: The Type 2 approach can increase the data size significantly as each change results in a new record.
- Complexity: Maintaining and querying the data becomes more complex due to the presence of multiple versions.

## Conclusion

Handling slowly changing dimensions in time series databases is essential for accurate data analyses and historical tracking. The choice between Type 1 and Type 2 techniques depends on the specific requirements of the system.  While Type 1 offers simplicity and a smaller database size, it sacrifices historical analysis and audit trail. Type 2, on the other hand, provides a complete historical view and audit trail, albeit with increased complexity and data size.

Regardless of the technique chosen, it is crucial to understand the nature of the dimensions and the impact of different change management approaches. Carefully considering the requirements of the system will help in determining the most appropriate technique for handling slowly changing dimensions in time series databases.
