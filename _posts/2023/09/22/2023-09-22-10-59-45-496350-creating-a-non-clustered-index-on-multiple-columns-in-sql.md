In SQL, indexes are used to improve the performance of queries by allowing faster data retrieval. By creating an index on one or more columns, you can significantly speed up the search process.

## What is a Non-Clustered Index?

A non-clustered index is a type of index that is created separately from the data, pointing to the actual data records. It provides a way to quickly locate the rows that match a specific condition without actually scanning the entire table. Unlike a clustered index, a non-clustered index doesn't determine the physical order of the data on disk.

## Creating a Non-Clustered Index on Multiple Columns

To create a non-clustered index on multiple columns in SQL, you can use the `CREATE INDEX` statement with the `NONCLUSTERED` keyword.

### Syntax:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...)
```

Let's say we have a table called `customers` with columns `last_name`, `first_name`, and `email`. We want to create a non-clustered index on both `last_name` and `first_name` columns.

### Example:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_customers_lastname_firstname
ON customers (last_name, first_name)
```

In the above example, we create a non-clustered index named `idx_customers_lastname_firstname` on the `customers` table for the `last_name` and `first_name` columns.

By creating an index on multiple columns, SQL can use this index to search records based on both `last_name` and `first_name` together, rather than just one column at a time. This can greatly improve the performance of queries that involve filtering or sorting on these columns.

## Conclusion

Creating a non-clustered index on multiple columns in SQL can significantly enhance the performance of your queries. By carefully choosing the columns to include in the index, you can optimize the search process and speed up data retrieval. It is important to note that creating too many indexes or including unnecessary columns in the index can negatively impact the performance of data modification operations. So, it's crucial to strike a balance between the benefits of indexes and the trade-off in terms of storage and maintenance overhead.
