Yes, it is possible to have multiple non-clustered indexes on the same table in most database management systems (DBMS). Non-clustered indexes are separate data structures that store a copy of a subset of the data from the table, allowing for efficient and quick data retrieval.

Having multiple non-clustered indexes can be beneficial in scenarios where you need to optimize different types of queries on the same table. Each index can be created on different columns or combinations of columns, allowing the DBMS to choose the most appropriate index for a specific query.

However, it is important to consider the trade-offs of having multiple indexes on a table. Indexes come with maintenance overhead, as they need to be updated whenever the underlying table data changes. This can impact the performance of data modification operations such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Additionally, indexes consume disk space, so creating too many can lead to increased storage requirements.

To strike a balance, it is recommended to carefully analyze your application's requirements and query patterns before deciding on the number and structure of non-clustered indexes for a table. Proper index tuning and periodic review of index usage can help ensure optimal performance with minimal overhead.
