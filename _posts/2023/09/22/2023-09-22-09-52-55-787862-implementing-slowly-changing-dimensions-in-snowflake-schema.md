In data warehousing, slowly changing dimensions (SCDs) refer to the ability to capture and store historical and changing data over time. Snowflake schema is a widely used data modeling technique in data warehousing systems. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement slowly changing dimensions in a Snowflake schema.

## What are Slowly Changing Dimensions?

Slowly changing dimensions are those dimensions in a data warehouse that change over time. The changes can be classified into different types:

1. Type 1 SCD: In this type, the existing record is overwritten with the new data, thereby losing the historical information.

2. Type 2 SCD: In this type, a new record is added to the dimension table for each change, maintaining historical data.

3. Type 3 SCD: In this type, the dimension table has separate columns to store the current and previous versions of the data, preserving limited historical information.

## Implementing Slowly Changing Dimensions in Snowflake Schema

Snowflake schema is a dimensional model that consists of a central fact table surrounded by multiple dimension tables, connected through primary-foreign key relationships. Here's how you can implement slowly changing dimensions in a Snowflake schema:

### Type 1 SCD

To implement Type 1 SCD in Snowflake schema, you can directly update the existing record in the dimension table with the new values whenever a change occurs. This approach is suitable when preserving historical information is not a requirement.

```sql
-- Example SQL code for Type 1 SCD
UPDATE dimension_table
SET attribute = 'new_value'
WHERE dimension_key = 'desired_key';
```

### Type 2 SCD

To implement Type 2 SCD in Snowflake schema, you need to create a separate table, commonly known as a "history" or "changes" table, to store the historical versions of the dimension data. When a change occurs, a new record is inserted into the dimension table, and the previous record is moved to the history table.

```sql
-- Example SQL code for Type 2 SCD
INSERT INTO dimension_table (dimension_key, attribute)
VALUES ('new_key', 'new_value');

INSERT INTO history_table (dimension_key, attribute, effective_date, expiration_date)
SELECT dimension_key, attribute, current_date, NULL
FROM dimension_table
WHERE dimension_key = 'desired_key';

UPDATE history_table
SET expiration_date = current_date
WHERE dimension_key = 'desired_key';
```

### Type 3 SCD

To implement Type 3 SCD in Snowflake schema, you need to add additional columns to the dimension table to store the current and previous versions of the data. The current version is updated whenever a change occurs, and the previous version is preserved in the respective column.

```sql
-- Example SQL code for Type 3 SCD
UPDATE dimension_table
SET previous_value = current_value,
    current_value = 'new_value'
WHERE dimension_key = 'desired_key';
```

## Conclusion

Slowly changing dimensions are essential in capturing and storing historical and changing data in a data warehouse. By implementing different types of slowly changing dimensions in a Snowflake schema, you can effectively manage and analyze changing data over time. Whether it's Type 1, Type 2, or Type 3 SCD, Snowflake schema provides the flexibility and scalability to handle these requirements in a structured manner.
