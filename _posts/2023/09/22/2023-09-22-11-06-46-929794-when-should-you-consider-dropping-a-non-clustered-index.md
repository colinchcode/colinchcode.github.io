In database management, indexes play a crucial role in optimizing query performance. They provide a way to quickly locate data, improving the efficiency of data retrieval operations. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to drop or remove non-clustered indexes to improve overall database performance. In this blog post, we will explore situations where dropping a non-clustered index can be considered.

**1. Indexes with Little or No Utilization**

One scenario to consider is when a non-clustered index is rarely or never used. Indexes that have low or no utilization consume storage space and can negatively impact insert/update/delete operations. To determine the utilization of an index, you can monitor the query execution plans or use tools like SQL Server's Query Store or Database Tuning Advisor. If an index is not being used or is used sparingly, it might be worthwhile to drop it to reduce overhead and improve write performance.

**2. Redundant or Duplicate Indexes**

Another situation when you might want to drop a non-clustered index is when it duplicates the functionality of another index. Redundant indexes add unnecessary overhead during data modification operations and consume additional storage space. It is essential to periodically review and analyze the existing indexes to identify any duplication or redundancy. If you find redundant indexes, consider dropping the duplicate ones to streamline index maintenance and improve overall performance.

**Conclusion**

Dropping non-clustered indexes should be done cautiously and after thorough analysis. It is recommended to monitor and analyze the workload and query behavior before deciding to drop an index. You can use tools like SQL Server Profiler, Extended Events, or Query Store to capture and evaluate the query execution plans and index utilization. Dropping unnecessary or redundant indexes can help streamline database maintenance, reduce storage overhead, and improve overall database performance.
