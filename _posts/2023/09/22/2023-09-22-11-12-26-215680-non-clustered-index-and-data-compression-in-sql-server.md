In SQL Server, indexes play a crucial role in improving query performance. One such type of index is the non-clustered index. Unlike the clustered index that determines the physical order of the data in a table, a non-clustered index is a separate structure that provides a quick lookup mechanism to locate data in a table.

**Advantages of Non-clustered Index:**
- Faster data retrieval for SELECT queries since it does not require scanning the entire table.
- Allows efficient filtering and sorting of data.
- Reduces I/O operations by minimizing the number of disk reads.

**Creating a Non-clustered Index:**
```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_name 
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```
In the above example, `idx_name` is the name of the non-clustered index, `table_name` is the name of the table, and `column1, column2, ...` are the columns on which the index is created.

**Using Non-clustered Indexes:**
Non-clustered indexes are automatically used by the SQL Server query optimizer when it determines that using the index will improve query performance. However, it's important to design and maintain indexes correctly to achieve optimal performance.

# Data Compression in SQL Server

Data compression is a technique used to reduce the amount of storage space required by data in a SQL Server database. It can significantly reduce storage costs and improve overall system performance by reducing I/O operations.

**Types of Data Compression in SQL Server:**

1. **Row Compression:**
   - Row compression reduces the storage size of fixed and variable-length data types.
   - It achieves compression by removing trailing zeros in fixed-length fields and applying various algorithms for variable-length fields.
   - Row compression is suitable for OLTP workloads where the focus is on reducing storage size.

   Enable row compression with the following command:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name REBUILD WITH (DATA_COMPRESSION = ROW);
   ```

2. **Page Compression:**
   - Page compression goes beyond row compression by also compressing the data at the page level.
   - It achieves higher compression ratios and further reduces storage space.
   - Page compression is suitable for data warehousing and reporting scenarios where large amounts of data are stored.

   Enable page compression with the following command:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE table_name REBUILD WITH (DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE);
   ```

**Benefits of Data Compression:**
- Reduced storage requirements, saving disk space and potentially lowering costs.
- Improved query performance by reducing I/O operations.
- Faster backups and restores due to reduced data volume.
- Efficient use of memory, as compressed data requires less space in the buffer cache.

By utilizing non-clustered indexes and data compression in SQL Server, you can significantly enhance your database performance and optimize storage resources.
