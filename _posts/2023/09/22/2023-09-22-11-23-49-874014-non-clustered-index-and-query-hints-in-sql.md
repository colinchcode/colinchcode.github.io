When working with large databases, a well-designed index can significantly improve query performance. In SQL, we have two types of indexes - clustered and non-clustered indexes. While a clustered index determines the physical storage order of data in a table, a non-clustered index provides a logical order.

## Understanding Non-Clustered Index

A non-clustered index is stored separately from the actual data and contains a sorted list of key values. Each key value points to the actual data row in the table. This allows for efficient searching and retrieval of data based on the indexed column(s).

Unlike a clustered index, a table can have multiple non-clustered indexes. Each non-clustered index has its own storage area and can be created on any column(s) of a table.

## Benefits of Non-Clustered Index

1. Improved Query Performance: Non-clustered indexes help in faster data retrieval by reducing the number of disk I/O operations needed for queries. When a query references an indexed column, the database engine uses the non-clustered index to locate the required data, rather than scanning the entire table.

2. Sorting and Filtering: Non-clustered indexes are useful for sorting and filtering operations. With a non-clustered index, the database can avoid sorting data on the fly during queries, resulting in faster query execution.

3. Covering Indexes: A non-clustered index can be a covering index, meaning it includes all the columns required for a particular query. This eliminates the need for the database engine to look up the actual table data, further improving query performance.

## Using Query Hints to Optimize Queries

In some scenarios, the SQL Server query optimizer may not select the most efficient execution plan for a query. In such cases, we can use query hints to provide specific instructions to the optimizer, guiding it to choose a more suitable plan.

1. **INDEX** Hint: This hint allows you to specify the index that should be used for a specific query. By providing the name of a non-clustered index with the `INDEX` hint, you can override the optimizer's choice and force it to use your specified index.

   Example Usage:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table WITH (INDEX(index_name)) WHERE condition;
   ```

2. **FORCESEEK** Hint: This hint instructs the optimizer to use an index seek operation instead of a table scan or index scan. It is useful when you are confident that the seek operation is more efficient for a given query.

   Example Usage:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM table WITH (FORCESEEK) WHERE condition;
   ```

Using query hints should be done with caution, as it overrides the optimizer's decisions. It is recommended to thoroughly test query performance before introducing hints in a production environment.

Remember, a well-designed index and appropriate use of query hints can greatly improve the performance of your SQL queries, ensuring faster and more efficient data retrieval.
