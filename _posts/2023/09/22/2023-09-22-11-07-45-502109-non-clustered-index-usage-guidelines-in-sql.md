In SQL, indexes are used to improve the performance of database queries by allowing faster data retrieval. One type of index commonly used is the non-clustered index. This index is created on a specific column or set of columns, and it contains a copy of the indexed column(s) as well as a pointer to the actual data.

Non-clustered indexes have their own set of guidelines for effective usage. Here are some guidelines to consider when working with non-clustered indexes in SQL:

## 1. Selectivity is Key
Non-clustered indexes are most effective when they are highly selective, meaning they reduce the number of rows the database must search to satisfy a query. Indexes with low selectivity may not provide significant performance improvements. It's important to carefully choose the columns to index based on their selectivity.

## 2. Avoid Over-Indexing
While indexes can improve query performance, having too many indexes on a table can negatively impact database performance. Each index consumes additional disk space and requires maintenance during data modifications. Over-indexing can lead to slower insert, update, and delete operations. **Maintaining a balance** between the number of indexes and the needs of your queries is recommended.

## 3. Consider Column Order
When creating a non-clustered index on multiple columns, consider the order of the columns in the index definition. Placing the more selective columns first can provide better query performance. Ordering is important because queries may only benefit from the index if they include the leftmost columns in the index.

## 4. Index Key Length
Keep the index key length as short as possible to reduce the size of the index. A shorter index key means more entries fit on a single page, resulting in fewer disk reads and improved performance. Avoid including unnecessary columns in the index key to reduce its size.

## 5. Limit Included Columns
Non-clustered indexes allow for the inclusion of non-key or covering columns. Including too many columns can increase the index size, reducing the benefits of the index. Only include the necessary columns to cover the query requirements.

Following these guidelines will help you make better decisions when working with non-clustered indexes in SQL. Remember that indexing is a tradeoff between query performance and the overhead of maintaining the indexes. Therefore, it's essential to periodically review and optimize your indexes based on the specific needs of your database.
