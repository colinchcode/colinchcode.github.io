In SQL Server, an index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. A non-clustered index is one of the indexing options in SQL Server and is created on a specific column or set of columns. Unlike a clustered index, which determines the physical order of data in a table, a non-clustered index does not affect the physical storage order.

## How Does a Non-clustered Index Work?

When a database query is executed, the SQL Server query optimizer uses the index to quickly locate the relevant data. The non-clustered index contains a copy of the indexed column(s) along with a pointer to the actual data row(s). This allows for faster retrieval of data matching the indexed column(s).

## Benefits of Non-clustered Indexes

1. **Improved Query Performance:** Non-clustered indexes can significantly improve query performance, especially for large tables. By reducing the number of disk IO operations needed to locate specific data, database queries can execute faster.

2. **Better Sorting and Filtering:** Non-clustered indexes can help in sorting and filtering data efficiently. They allow quick access to specific data based on the columns included in the index.

3. **Reduced Lock Contention:** Non-clustered indexes can help reduce lock contention by providing alternate paths to access data. This can result in improved concurrency and reduced blocking situations.

## Creating a Non-clustered Index

To create a non-clustered index on a table, you can use the `CREATE INDEX` statement in SQL Server. Here's an example of creating a non-clustered index on the "LastName" column of the "Customers" table:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_Customers_LastName
ON Customers(LastName)
```

In this example, the non-clustered index named "IX_Customers_LastName" is created on the "LastName" column of the "Customers" table.

## Index Rebuild in SQL Server

Over time, as data is inserted, updated, and deleted in a database table, the indexes can become fragmented, leading to decreased performance. Index rebuild is a maintenance operation in SQL Server that helps optimize the performance of indexes.

## Benefits of Index Rebuild

1. **Improved Query Performance:** Index rebuild consolidates fragmented index pages, resulting in improved query performance. Queries that access the rebuilt index can execute faster due to fewer disk IO operations.

2. **Reduced Storage Space:** Index rebuild can also reduce the storage space required for indexes. By eliminating fragmentation, the index structure becomes more compact, leading to efficient use of disk space.

3. **Optimized Index Maintenance:** Rebuilding indexes can help optimize index maintenance operations, such as index updates, statistics updates, and backups. This can lead to more efficient database maintenance tasks.

## Rebuilding Indexes

In SQL Server, you can rebuild indexes using the `ALTER INDEX` statement with the `REBUILD` option. Here's an example of rebuilding an index named "IX_Customers_LastName" on the "Customers" table:

```sql
ALTER INDEX IX_Customers_LastName
ON Customers
REBUILD
```

In this example, the non-clustered index named "IX_Customers_LastName" on the "Customers" table is rebuilt.

## Conclusion

Non-clustered indexes are valuable tools in SQL Server to improve query performance and provide efficient data retrieval capabilities. Regularly rebuilding indexes is essential for maintaining optimal database performance. By understanding the role of non-clustered indexes and index rebuilding, you can effectively optimize your SQL Server databases for better performance.
