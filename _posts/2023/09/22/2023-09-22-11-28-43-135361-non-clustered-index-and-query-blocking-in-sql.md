In SQL databases, indexes play a crucial role in optimizing query performance. A non-clustered index is an additional data structure that enhances the search capabilities of a database table. However, there are instances when using non-clustered indexes can lead to query blocking.

## Understanding Non-clustered Indexes

A non-clustered index is a separate structure from the table that contains the indexed columns' copies along with additional pointers. These indexes speed up search operations, as the database engine can quickly locate the values within the index structure instead of scanning the entire table.

## Query Blocking and Non-clustered Indexes

Query blocking occurs when one active transaction blocks other transactions from accessing the required resources, leading to delays and decreased performance. Non-clustered indexes can contribute to query blocking in the following scenarios:

1. **Key Lookups**: When a query utilizes a non-clustered index to find rows based on certain columns, it may still need to perform additional key lookups to retrieve other column data from the actual table. These lookups require acquiring additional locks, potentially causing blocking if other transactions need access to the same resources.

2. **Range Scans**: Non-clustered indexes may encounter range scans, where multiple rows are accessed using a range of values. When such scans are performed, locks are held on the index, and if conflicting locks are requested by other transactions, query blocking can occur.

## Mitigating Query Blocking with Non-clustered Indexes

To minimize query blocking related to non-clustered indexes, consider the following strategies:

1. **Covering Indexes**: Create covering indexes that include all the columns required by the query. This eliminates the need for additional key lookups, reducing the chances of blocking. However, note that including too many columns in the index can lead to increased index size and slower inserts/updates.

2. **Index Tuning**: Regularly analyze query execution plans and identify potential areas for optimization. Ensure that appropriate indexes are created for frequently executed queries, and avoid creating indexes that are not being used. This helps to improve query performance and reduce blocking instances.

3. **Isolation Levels**: Adjust the isolation level settings for different transactions based on their requirements. Reducing the isolation level can alleviate blocking issues by allowing for more concurrent access to resources. However, be cautious when modifying isolation levels, as it might lead to increased chances of data inconsistencies.

## Conclusion
Non-clustered indexes are valuable tools for improving query performance in SQL databases. However, they can also contribute to query blocking in certain scenarios. By understanding these potential problems and implementing appropriate mitigation techniques, you can strike a balance between performance optimization and avoiding query blocking instances.
