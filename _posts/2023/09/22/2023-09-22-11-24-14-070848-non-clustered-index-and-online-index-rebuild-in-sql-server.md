When it comes to optimizing database performance, one of the key factors to consider is the efficient retrieval of data. In SQL Server, one way to achieve this is by using non-clustered indexes.

Unlike clustered indexes, which determine the physical order of data in a table, non-clustered indexes provide an alternative way to access data stored in a table. They consist of a separate structure that includes the indexed columns and a pointer to the actual data in the table.

## Benefits of Non-Clustered Indexes

Non-clustered indexes offer several advantages:

1. **Faster Data Retrieval**: Non-clustered indexes allow for quicker search and retrieval operations, especially when querying large tables. The index structure acts as a map, enabling the database engine to locate specific rows efficiently.

2. **Improved Query Performance**: By using non-clustered indexes appropriately, you can significantly reduce the time it takes to execute queries. The query optimizer can leverage these indexes to generate more efficient execution plans.

3. **Covering Indexes**: Non-clustered indexes can include additional columns besides the indexed ones. This feature allows queries to be satisfied entirely from the index itself, eliminating the need for accessing the underlying data pages.

## Implementing Non-Clustered Indexes

You can create non-clustered indexes on one or more columns in a table, depending on the specific requirements of your queries. The syntax to create a non-clustered index in SQL Server is as follows:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

Ensure that the columns used in the index are frequently searched or involved in join or filter conditions. However, be cautious when creating too many non-clustered indexes, as they come with overhead in terms of disk space and maintenance.

## Online Index Rebuild in SQL Server

In SQL Server, index maintenance is an essential task to keep your database performing optimally. The index rebuild operation reorganizes or rebuilds the index structures to eliminate fragmentation and reclaim storage space.

Usually, an index rebuild operation requires an exclusive lock on the table, preventing any concurrent access. However, SQL Server introduces the concept of **online index rebuild**, which allows for concurrent data modifications and query access to the table during the rebuild operation.

## Benefits of Online Index Rebuild

Online index rebuild offers several advantages:

1. **Reduced Downtime**: Traditional offline index rebuild operations can cause significant downtime for applications that rely on the affected tables. Online index rebuild allows continuous data access, minimizing disruptions to user activities.

2. **Improved Scalability**: By allowing concurrent access, online index rebuild enables you to maintain optimal performance for applications with high data modification rates.

3. **Flexible Scheduling**: You can schedule online index rebuild operations during off-peak hours to minimize the impact on system resources and user experience.

## Performing an Online Index Rebuild

To perform an online index rebuild in SQL Server, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER INDEX index_name ON table_name REBUILD WITH (ONLINE = ON);
```

The `ONLINE = ON` option ensures that the index rebuild operation happens online, allowing concurrent access to the table. Depending on the size of the table and system resources, online index rebuild may take longer than offline rebuild operations.

It's important to note that online index rebuild requires the Enterprise edition of SQL Server. Additionally, keep an eye on system resource utilization during the rebuild operation to avoid any performance degradation.
