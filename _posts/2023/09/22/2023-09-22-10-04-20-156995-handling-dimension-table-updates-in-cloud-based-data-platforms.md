In a cloud-based data platform, dimension tables are fundamental components that store descriptive attributes about the data in a data warehouse or a data lake. These tables provide context and help in performing analysis and reporting on the data.

However, handling updates to dimension tables can be a challenge, especially in large-scale data platforms where data is constantly changing and being ingested from various sources. In this blog post, we will explore some best practices for handling dimension table updates in cloud-based data platforms.

## 1. Incremental Updates with Change Data Capture (CDC)

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique that captures and persists incremental changes to a data source. By leveraging CDC, you can track changes made to the source systems and apply these changes to the dimension tables in your data platform.

CDC can be implemented using native tools provided by cloud-based data platforms, such as AWS DMS (Database Migration Service) or AWS Glue. These tools capture changes made to the source data and replicate them to the destination, ensuring that dimension tables are always up to date.

## 2. Stream-based Processing with Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that allows you to build real-time data pipelines and process streams of records. Leveraging Kafka, you can capture the changes made to the source systems and update the dimension tables in near real-time.

By subscribing to the change stream generated by the source system, you can consume and process the changes using stream processing frameworks like Apache Flink or Apache Spark. These frameworks enable you to transform and update the dimension tables in real-time, keeping them synchronized with the source data.

## Conclusion

Handling dimension table updates in cloud-based data platforms requires careful planning and implementation. By leveraging techniques like Change Data Capture (CDC) or stream-based processing with Apache Kafka, you can ensure that your dimension tables are always up to date and provide accurate contextual information for your data analytics and reporting needs.
