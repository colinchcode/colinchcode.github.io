In SQL databases, indexes play a crucial role in improving query performance. One commonly used type of index is the non-clustered index. Unlike a clustered index that determines the physical order of data in a table, a non-clustered index is a separate structure that points to the data. 

**Why Use Non-clustered Index?**
- Faster data retrieval: Non-clustered index allows faster lookup and retrieval of data since it provides a direct path to the required records.
- Efficient sorting and filtering: Non-clustered index helps in efficient sorting and filtering operations, especially when querying large amounts of data.
- Reduced disk I/O: Non-clustered index reduces disk I/O operations because the query optimizer can quickly locate the desired data.

**Creating a Non-clustered Index**
To create a non-clustered index on a table, you can use the `CREATE INDEX` statement followed by the index name, table name, and column(s) on which you want to create the index.

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);
```

**Example**
Consider a table called `users` with columns `id`, `name`, and `email`. To create a non-clustered index on the `name` column, you can use the following SQL query:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name
ON users (name);
```

Remember, you can create non-clustered indexes on multiple columns as well. The order of columns in the index can affect performance, so choose wisely based on your queries.

# Join Operations in SQL

Join operations in SQL are used to combine records from two or more tables based on related columns. Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single query.

There are different types of joins in SQL:
- **Inner Join**: Returns only the matching records from both tables.
- **Left Join**: Returns all records from the left table and the matching records from the right table.
- **Right Join**: Returns all records from the right table and the matching records from the left table.
- **Full Join**: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table.

**Syntax for Inner Join**
The basic syntax for an inner join is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

**Example**
Suppose you have two tables named `orders` and `customers`. To retrieve the order details along with the customer information, you can use an inner join as shown below:

```sql
SELECT orders.order_id, orders.order_date, customers.customer_name
FROM orders
INNER JOIN customers
ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
```

This query will return the `order_id`, `order_date`, and `customer_name` where there is a matching `customer_id` in both tables.

**Remember** to choose the appropriate join type based on the relationship between tables and the desired output.
