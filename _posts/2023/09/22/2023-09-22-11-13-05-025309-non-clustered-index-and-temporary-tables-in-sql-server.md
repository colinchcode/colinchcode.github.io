In SQL Server, an index is a data structure that improves the speed of retrieving data from a database table. One type of index is the non-clustered index, which is a separate structure that contains a sorted copy of selected columns from the table's data.

A non-clustered index consists of two parts: the key columns and the included columns. The key columns define the index's order, while the included columns are additional columns that are stored in the index to improve query performance. 

To create a non-clustered index in SQL Server, use the `CREATE INDEX` statement:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_myindex
ON dbo.mytable (column1 ASC, column2 DESC)
INCLUDE (column3, column4);
```

In this example, `idx_myindex` is the name of the index, `dbo.mytable` is the table on which the index is created, and `(column1 ASC, column2 DESC)` specifies the sorting order for the key columns. The `INCLUDE` keyword is used to specify additional columns to be stored in the index.

Non-clustered indexes are particularly useful for improving performance in queries that involve searching, filtering, and joining tables. However, it's important to consider the trade-off between improved query performance and the increased storage space required for maintaining indexes.

# Temporary Tables in SQL Server

Temporary tables in SQL Server are tables that exist only during the connection session or the lifetime of a stored procedure. They are stored in the tempdb database and are used to hold temporary data that is needed for a specific query or task.

Creating a temporary table in SQL Server is done with the `CREATE TABLE` statement, but with a `#` prefix before the table name to indicate that it is a temporary table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE #temp_table
(
    column1 datatype,
    column2 datatype,
    ...
);
```

Temporary tables are especially useful when you need to perform complex calculations or manipulate data within a single query or stored procedure. They provide a way to break down a complex problem into smaller steps and store intermediate results for further processing.

Once the session or stored procedure ends, the temporary table is automatically dropped and its resources are released. This ensures that temporary tables do not impact the overall performance and storage requirements of the database.

In conclusion, non-clustered indexes and temporary tables are powerful features in SQL Server that can greatly enhance query performance and enable efficient data manipulation. By understanding how to use them effectively, you can optimize your SQL Server database and improve overall system performance.
