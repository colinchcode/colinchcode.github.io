When it comes to database management and optimization, non-clustered indexes play a crucial role in improving query performance. Over time, these indexes may become fragmented, leading to decreased performance. To address this issue, rebuilding or reorganizing the indexes is necessary. 

The question arises: can a non-clustered index be rebuilt online? The answer is **yes**. Since SQL Server 2005, Microsoft has introduced the ability to rebuild non-clustered indexes online, providing a significant advantage by minimizing downtime during maintenance operations. 

To execute an online rebuild of a non-clustered index in SQL Server, you can leverage the `ALTER INDEX` command. Here's an example:

```sql
ALTER INDEX [Index_Name] ON [Table_Name] REBUILD WITH (ONLINE = ON);
```

In this command, replace `[Index_Name]` with the name of the non-clustered index you want to rebuild and `[Table_Name]` with the name of the table containing the index. 

The `ONLINE = ON` option is the key to performing an online index rebuild. By enabling this option, the rebuild operation can take place while concurrent operations on the table are still allowed. This means that the index remains accessible for queries during the rebuild process, ensuring minimal disruption to the application. 

It's important to note that performing online index rebuilds may require more system resources and may take longer compared to offline rebuilds. Hence, it's recommended to plan and schedule the maintenance process accordingly.

To monitor the progress of the online index rebuild, you can use system views like `sys.dm_db_index_operational_stats` or check the output of the `ALTER INDEX` command.

By utilizing the ability to rebuild non-clustered indexes online, database administrators can optimize query performance and maintain a high level of availability for their SQL Server systems.
