When working with large databases, optimizing the performance of queries becomes crucial. One effective way to improve query performance is by utilizing indexes. Indexes allow for quick data retrieval by creating a data structure that organizes and sorts the data in a specific manner. In SQL Server, two commonly used types of indexes are non-clustered indexes and index statistics.

## Non-Clustered Index

A non-clustered index is a data structure separate from the actual data storage that allows for efficient lookup and retrieval of specific data. Unlike clustered indexes, non-clustered indexes do not determine the physical order of the data in the table. Instead, they create a separate structure that points to the actual data.

Consider a scenario where you have a large table with millions of records, and you frequently query the table based on a specific column. Creating a non-clustered index on that column can significantly improve the query performance. When the query is executed, instead of scanning the entire table, SQL Server can use the non-clustered index to quickly locate the desired data.

To create a non-clustered index in SQL Server, you can use the `CREATE INDEX` statement. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_ProductName
ON Products (ProductName);
```

In this example, we create a non-clustered index named `idx_ProductName` on the `ProductName` column in the `Products` table.

## Index Statistics

Index statistics provide valuable information about the distribution of data within an index. SQL Server uses these statistics to estimate the number of rows that match a specific query criteria and determine the most efficient execution plan.

Index statistics include details such as the number of unique values, the density of the index, and the histogram of data distribution. This information helps the query optimizer make informed decisions on how to retrieve data effectively.

To view index statistics in SQL Server, you can use the `DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS` command. Here's an example:

```sql
DBCC SHOW_STATISTICS ('dbo.Products', 'idx_ProductName');
```

In this example, we view the statistics of the `idx_ProductName` index in the `Products` table.

**Non-Clustered Index and Index Statistics: Improving Query Performance**

By creating non-clustered indexes on frequently queried columns and utilizing index statistics, you can significantly enhance the performance of your SQL Server database. Invest time in analyzing query execution plans and understanding the distribution of data within indexes to fine-tune your database for optimal performance.
