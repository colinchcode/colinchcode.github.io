The concept of slowly changing dimensions (SCD) is crucial when working with databases that store historical data. SCD refers to the changes that occur over time in the dimensions of a data model. Memory-oriented databases, which prioritize fast data access and manipulation, require specific techniques to handle SCD efficiently. In this blog post, we will discuss some techniques for effectively managing slowly changing dimensions in memory-oriented databases.

## 1. Type 1 SCD: Overwrite Existing Values

Type 1 SCD is the simplest approach to handle slowly changing dimensions. In this technique, the existing values in the dimension table are overwritten with the new values without preserving historical information. This method works well when historical data is not important, and only the latest values matter.

To implement Type 1 SCD in a memory-oriented database, you can use an UPDATE statement to modify the dimension table with the new values. As memory-oriented databases are optimized for read and write operations, this approach can be efficient for quickly updating dimension values.

However, it's important to note that by overwriting existing values, you lose the ability to track and analyze historical changes. This technique is suitable only when historical data is not a requirement.

## 2. Type 2 SCD: Keep Historical Versions

Type 2 SCD is a more comprehensive approach that keeps track of historical changes by creating new records for each update in the dimension table. This technique allows you to preserve a historical perspective and analyze changes over time.

To implement Type 2 SCD in a memory-oriented database, you need to introduce an additional field, typically referred to as a surrogate key or version number, to uniquely identify each version of the dimension. Whenever a change occurs, a new record is inserted with a new version number and the updated values. By doing this, you maintain a complete history of the dimension data.

While implementing Type 2 SCD in memory-oriented databases, it's essential to consider performance implications. As these databases prioritize speed, handling large volumes of historical data can impact performance. One optimization technique is to partition the dimension table based on time, helping to reduce the query time when accessing specific time intervals.

By choosing Type 2 SCD, you gain the ability to analyze historical changes and track the transformation of dimensions over time, albeit with an increased storage requirement.

## Conclusion

Memory-oriented databases provide excellent performance for data access and manipulation. However, efficiently managing slowly changing dimensions requires proper techniques to handle historical data. By using either Type 1 or Type 2 SCD techniques, you can cater to different requirements based on the importance of historical information.

The key lies in understanding your data model, requirements, and performance considerations to choose the appropriate approach. Whether you prioritize speed with Type 1 SCD or the ability to analyze historical changes with Type 2 SCD, memory-oriented databases offer flexibility in handling slowly changing dimensions.
