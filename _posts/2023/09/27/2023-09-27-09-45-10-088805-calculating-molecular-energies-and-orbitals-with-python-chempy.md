ChemPy is a powerful Python library for performing various computational chemistry calculations. In this tutorial, we will learn how to calculate molecular energies and visualize the molecular orbitals using ChemPy.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- ChemPy library (`pip install chempy`)

## Importing Required Libraries

First, let's import the required libraries:

```python
import chempy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Loading Molecular Structure

To calculate the molecular energies and orbitals, we need to load the molecular structure. ChemPy provides various methods for loading molecular structures from different file formats such as XYZ, PDB, etc.

In this example, let's assume we have a molecule stored in a XYZ file format called `molecule.xyz`. We can load it using the following code:

```python
mol = chempy.readfile("xyz", "molecule.xyz").next()
```

## Calculating Molecular Energies

Once we have loaded the molecular structure, we can calculate the molecular energies using the appropriate method provided by ChemPy. For example, to calculate the electronic energy, we can use the following code:

```python
energy = chempy.energy_methods.HF(mol).get_energy()
print('Electronic Energy:', energy)
```

## Visualizing Molecular Orbitals

ChemPy allows us to visualize the molecular orbitals. We can use the `chempy.view` method to generate the molecular orbital plots. Here's an example:

```python
orbitals = chempy.orbitals.GuessGenerator(mol).generate_single_guess()[0]
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(orbitals), figsize=(8, 6*len(orbitals)))

for i, orbital in enumerate(orbitals):
    plot = chempy.plot.molden_mo.make_plot(mol, orbital, ax=ax[i])
    plot.set_title(f"MO {i+1}")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

The above code will generate a plot for each molecular orbital, displaying them one by one.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to calculate molecular energies and visualize molecular orbitals using ChemPy. ChemPy provides a wide range of tools for computational chemistry, making it a valuable library for any chemist or researcher working in the field.

Remember to check the official ChemPy documentation for more details on the available methods and functionalities. Happy coding!
