Theano is a popular library in Python used for deep learning and mathematical computation. One of the key features of Theano is its ability to compile mathematical expressions into highly optimized code, making it efficient for executing computations on both CPUs and GPUs.

In this blog post, we will explore how to compile Theano functions and leverage the benefits of code optimization.

## 1. Introduction to Theano Functions

Theano functions are created by defining symbolic expressions using variables, operations, and mathematical functions provided by Theano. These functions can then be compiled to generate efficient code for execution, either on a CPU or a GPU.

## 2. Compiling Theano Functions

To compile a Theano function, we need to define the inputs and outputs of the function using Theano variables. Then, using the `theano.function` method, we compile the symbolic expression into a callable function.

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

# Define input variables
x = T.dmatrix('x')
y = T.dmatrix('y')

# Define symbolic expression
z = x + y

# Compile theano function
addition_func = theano.function(inputs=[x, y], outputs=z)
```

In this example, we define two input variables `x` and `y` as `dmatrix` (double matrix) in Theano. We then define a symbolic expression `z` as the sum of `x` and `y`. Finally, we compile the Theano function using `theano.function` by specifying the inputs and outputs.

### 2.1 Default Mode

Theano provides two modes for function compilation: `Mode` and `FastCompileMode`. By default, the function is compiled using the `Mode` optimizer, which performs various optimizations, including constant folding, dynamic code generation, and memory recycling.

```python
import theano.compile
theano.config.mode = 'Mode'
```

### 2.2 Fast Mode

If you prioritize speed over the optimizations provided by the default mode, you can use the `FastCompileMode`. It skips some of the more computationally expensive optimization steps to generate code faster.

```python
theano.config.mode = 'FastCompileMode'
```

### 2.3 Shared Variables and Updates

Theano allows the usage of shared variables which can be updated during function execution. This is useful for maintaining stateful computations or implementing gradient descent optimization algorithms.

```python
# Define shared variable
w = theano.shared(0.0, name='w')

# Define update expression
update_exp = w + 1

# Compile theano function with updates
update_func = theano.function([], [], updates=[(w, update_exp)])
```

In this example, we create a shared variable `w` initialized with 0.0. We then define an update expression `update_exp` where `w` is incremented by 1. Finally, we compile the Theano function `update_func` with no inputs or outputs and specify the updates to be performed.

## 3. Advantages of Compiled Theano Functions

When using compiled Theano functions, you can experience several advantages:

- **Performance**: Theano optimizes the generated code to achieve high-performance execution, making it suitable for large-scale mathematical computations.
- **Portability**: The compiled functions can run on various platforms, including CPUs and GPUs, allowing you to leverage hardware accelerations.
- **Integration**: Theano seamlessly integrates with other Python libraries, such as NumPy, SciPy, and libraries for deep learning like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## 4. Final Thoughts

Compiling Theano functions can significantly improve the performance of your mathematical computations. By leveraging the efficient code generation capabilities of Theano, you can achieve faster execution times and take advantage of hardware acceleration for enhanced performance.

Remember to choose the appropriate compilation mode and consider using shared variables and updates for stateful computations and optimization algorithms.

Happy coding!
