Theano is a Python library that allows for efficient mathematical computations, particularly in the field of deep learning. While it provides excellent performance on a single machine, there are scenarios where distributed computing becomes necessary to handle larger datasets or complex models. In this blog post, we will explore how to leverage Theano's built-in capabilities for distributed computing.

## Why Distributed Computing?

Distributed computing offers several advantages when working with large datasets and computationally intensive tasks. It allows us to distribute the workload across multiple machines, effectively reducing the time required to complete the computations. Additionally, distributing the workload across multiple machines enables us to handle larger datasets that may not fit into memory on a single machine.

## Setting up a Distributed Environment

Before diving into the details of distributed computing with Theano, we need to set up a distributed environment. There are various tools available for distributed computing, such as Apache Spark, Dask, and TensorFlow. In this post, we'll focus on setting up a simple distributed environment using Dask.

To get started, you'll need to install Dask by running the following command:

```python
pip install dask
```

Once installed, you can create a distributed cluster by running the following code:

```python
import dask.distributed as dask_dist

# Create a local cluster with four workers
cluster = dask_dist.LocalCluster(n_workers=4)

# Connect to the cluster
client = dask_dist.Client(cluster)
```

This code creates a local cluster with four workers and connects to it using the `dask_dist.Client` object. This allows us to submit tasks to the cluster and monitor their progress.

## Leveraging Theano's Distributed Computing Capabilities

Now that we have a distributed environment set up, we can leverage Theano's built-in capabilities for distributed computing. Theano provides a module called `theano.d3viz` that allows us to visualize the computation graph and identify opportunities for parallelism.

Once we have identified potential areas for parallelism, we can use Theano's `theano.function` decorator to mark certain functions for distributed execution. This decorator allows us to specify the target device (e.g., GPU) or distributed backend (e.g., Dask) on which the function should be executed.

Here's an example of how to mark a function for distributed execution using Theano:

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

@theano.function(on_unused_input='ignore', target='dask')
def parallel_function(input1, input2):
    # Your computation code here
    output = ...
    return output

# Submit the distributed task to the cluster
future = client.submit(parallel_function, input1, input2)
```

In this example, we use the `theano.function` decorator to mark the `parallel_function` for execution on the Dask distributed backend. We then submit the function to the cluster using the `client.submit` method.

## Monitoring and Managing Distributed Tasks

Once we have submitted a distributed task, we can monitor its progress and manage the cluster resources using Dask's dashboard. The dashboard provides real-time information about the computation graph, task status, and resource utilization.

To launch the Dask dashboard, you can run the following code:

```python
client.scheduler_info()['address']
```

This will provide you with the URL for accessing the Dask dashboard. By visiting this URL in your web browser, you can monitor the progress of your distributed tasks and manage the cluster resources.

## Conclusion

Distributed computing with Theano allows us to leverage the power of multiple machines to efficiently handle large datasets and complex models. By setting up a distributed environment using tools like Dask and leveraging Theano's distributed computing capabilities, we can achieve faster computations and scale our deep learning tasks.
