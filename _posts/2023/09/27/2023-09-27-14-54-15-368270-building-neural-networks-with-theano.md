## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are mathematical models inspired by the human brain. They consist of interconnected neurons, or computational units, organized in layers. Each neuron receives inputs, performs a computation, and produces an output.

Neural networks have various architectures, including feedforward networks, recurrent networks, and convolutional networks. These architectures can be used for tasks such as classification, regression, and sequence-to-sequence mapping.

## Getting Started with Theano

Theano is a popular library for numerical computation in Python. It provides efficient computation on both CPUs and GPUs, making it suitable for training deep neural networks. To get started with Theano, you can install it using `pip`:

```
pip install theano
```

Once installed, you can import it in your Python script or notebook to use its functionality:

```python
import theano
```

## Building a Feedforward Neural Network

A feedforward neural network is the simplest type of neural network, where information flows in a single direction, from input to output. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

To build a feedforward neural network using Theano, we can define the network architecture, initialize the parameters, and specify the forward computation. Here's an example of building a simple feedforward network with one hidden layer:

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

# Define the network architecture
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 5

X = T.matrix('X')
y = T.matrix('y')

W1 = theano.shared(np.random.randn(input_size, hidden_size))
b1 = theano.shared(np.zeros(hidden_size))
W2 = theano.shared(np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size))
b2 = theano.shared(np.zeros(output_size))

# Forward computation
hidden = T.tanh(T.dot(X, W1) + b1)
output = T.nnet.softmax(T.dot(hidden, W2) + b2)

# Compile the function
predict = theano.function(inputs=[X], outputs=output)
```

In this example, we define the network architecture by specifying the sizes of the input, hidden, and output layers. We initialize the weights and biases using `theano.shared` and define the forward computation using tensor operations.

## Training and Evaluating the Neural Network

Once the network is defined, we can train it using various optimization algorithms. Theano provides functions for defining the loss function, computing gradients, and updating the parameters.

```python
# Define the loss function
loss = T.nnet.categorical_crossentropy(output, y).mean()
# Update the parameters
learning_rate = 0.01
updates = [(param, param - learning_rate * T.grad(loss, param)) for param in [W1, b1, W2, b2]]

# Compile the training function
train = theano.function(inputs=[X, y], outputs=loss, updates=updates)

# Training the network
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Get the input and target data
    X_batch, y_batch = get_batch_data()

    # Train the network
    loss_value = train(X_batch, y_batch)

    # Print the loss value
    print(f"Epoch: {epoch}, Loss: {loss_value:.4f}")

# Evaluating the network
X_test, y_test = get_test_data()
predictions = predict(X_test)
```

In this example, we define the loss function using categorical cross-entropy, which is commonly used for classification problems. We compute the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters using `T.grad` and update the parameters using an optimizer.

## Recurrent Neural Networks with Theano

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are another type of neural network commonly used for sequence data. Theano provides functionality for building and training RNNs using its recurrent layer implementations.

To build an RNN with Theano, you can use the `theano.tensor.extra_ops.scan` function to define the recurrent computation. Here's an example of building an RNN with one recurrent layer:

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

# Define the network architecture
input_size = 10
hidden_size = 20
output_size = 5

X = T.matrix('X')
y = T.matrix('y')

W = theano.shared(np.random.randn(hidden_size, hidden_size))
V = theano.shared(np.random.randn(hidden_size, output_size))
b = theano.shared(np.zeros(output_size))
h0 = theano.shared(np.zeros(hidden_size))

# Forward computation
def step(x, h_prev):
    h = T.tanh(T.dot(x, W) + T.dot(h_prev, V))
    return h

hidden, _ = theano.scan(step, sequences=X, outputs_info=[h0])

output = T.nnet.softmax(T.dot(hidden[-1], V) + b)

# Compile the function
predict = theano.function(inputs=[X], outputs=output)
```

In this example, we define the recurrent computation using the `theano.tensor.extra_ops.scan` function. The `step` function represents a single step of the recurrent computation, which takes the input and the previous hidden state as inputs and returns the new hidden state. The `hidden` variable represents the sequence of hidden states computed by the RNN.

## Conclusion

Theano provides a powerful and flexible framework for building neural networks, making it a popular choice among machine learning practitioners. In this blog post, we covered the basics of building feedforward and recurrent neural networks using Theano. By leveraging the capabilities of Theano, you can easily experiment with different network architectures and train them efficiently on CPUs or GPUs. Happy coding!
