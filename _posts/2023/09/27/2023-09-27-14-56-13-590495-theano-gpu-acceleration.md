## Introduction to Theano
**Theano** is a popular open-source numerical computation library primarily used for deep learning. It provides a high-level interface to GPUs, allowing you to write code that automatically runs on the GPU, thereby leveraging its parallel processing capabilities.

## Installation
To get started with **Theano**, you need to install it on your system. You can install it using **pip** by running the following command:

```bash
pip install Theano
```

Once the installation is complete, **Theano** will be ready to use.

## Setting Up GPU Support
In order to use the GPU with **Theano**, you need to make sure that you have the appropriate GPU drivers installed on your system. You also need to install the CUDA toolkit provided by NVIDIA. Additionally, you need to have a compatible GPU device.

Please refer to the official documentation for detailed instructions on setting up GPU support with **Theano** based on your operating system and GPU brand.

## Basic Theano GPU Code Example
To demonstrate how to use **Theano** with GPU acceleration, let's consider a simple code example. We will calculate the element-wise sum of two arrays and print the result.

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

# Define inputs
a = T.vector()
b = T.vector()

# Define computation graph
c = a + b

# Compile function
add_vectors = theano.function([a, b], c)

# Create input arrays
input_a = [1, 2, 3]
input_b = [4, 5, 6]

# Call the compiled function
result = add_vectors(input_a, input_b)
print(result)
```

In the code above, we first import the necessary **Theano** libraries and define two input vectors `a` and `b`. We then define the computation graph, which simply adds the two input vectors element-wise. Next, we compile the function `add_vectors` that takes `a` and `b` as inputs and returns `c`. 

Finally, we create two input arrays `input_a` and `input_b` and pass them to the `add_vectors` function, which executes the computation on the GPU and returns the result.

## Conclusion
Using **Theano** to leverage GPU acceleration can significantly speed up your computations, especially for large-scale numerical operations. It provides an easy-to-use interface for efficiently utilizing the parallel processing capabilities of your GPU. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can start harnessing the power of the GPU with **Theano** in your Python projects.
