**Introduction**

Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique that aims to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text. It involves classifying text into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

**Theano**

Theano is a popular Python library for deep learning that allows efficient definition, optimization, and evaluation of mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays. It is widely used in the field of machine learning and has excellent support for building and training deep neural networks.

**Sentiment Analysis with Theano**

To perform sentiment analysis using Theano, we need to follow a few steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: First, we need to preprocess our text data. This involves steps such as tokenization, removing punctuation and special characters, converting text to lowercase, and removing stopwords. This will transform our raw text into a clean and structured format.

2. **Feature Extraction**: After preprocessing, we convert our text into numerical representations that can be used for training our model. Common methods include the Bag-of-Words representation or using word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe.

3. **Model Training**: The next step is to define our sentiment analysis model using Theano. This typically involves creating a deep neural network model with multiple layers such as input, hidden, and output layers. Various architectures such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used based on the specific requirements of the task.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Once the model is trained, we need to evaluate its performance. This involves testing the model on a separate dataset and calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its effectiveness.

5. **Deployment**: Finally, we can use the trained model to predict sentiment on new, unseen text data. The model can be integrated into web applications, chatbots, or any other system that requires sentiment analysis.

**Example Code**

Here is an example code snippet demonstrating sentiment analysis using Theano:

```python
import theano
import theano.tensor as T

class SentimentAnalysisModel:
    def __init__(self, input_size, num_classes):
        self.X = T.matrix('X')
        self.Y = T.ivector('Y')
        
        self.W = theano.shared(np.random.randn(input_size, num_classes), name='W')
        self.b = theano.shared(np.zeros(num_classes), name='b')
        
        self.pY = T.nnet.softmax(T.dot(self.X, self.W) + self.b)
        self.predicted_classes = T.argmax(self.pY, axis=1)
        
        self.cost = T.mean(T.nnet.categorical_crossentropy(self.pY, self.Y))
        self.updates = [(self.W, self.W - 0.01 * T.grad(self.cost, self.W)),
                        (self.b, self.b - 0.01 * T.grad(self.cost, self.b))]
        
    def train(self, X_train, Y_train, epochs):
        train_func = theano.function(inputs=[self.X, self.Y],
                                     outputs=self.cost,
                                     updates=self.updates,
                                     allow_input_downcast=True)
        
        for _ in range(epochs):
            train_func(X_train, Y_train)
        
    def predict(self, X_test):
        predict_func = theano.function(inputs=[self.X],
                                       outputs=self.predicted_classes,
                                       allow_input_downcast=True)
        
        return predict_func(X_test)
```

In the above code, we define a simple feed-forward neural network model using Theano. The model takes input features `X` and targets `Y`. We define the network architecture, calculate the predicted classes, and define the cost function to optimize. The training loop updates the weights and biases of the network using gradient descent. Finally, we can use the trained model to predict classes for new data.

**Conclusion**

Theano provides a powerful framework for building and training sentiment analysis models. By leveraging its deep learning capabilities, we can develop robust and accurate sentiment analysis systems that can analyze text and interpret emotions. With the example code provided, you can start experimenting with sentiment analysis using Theano in your own projects.
