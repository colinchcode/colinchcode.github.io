JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used format for data exchange between a server and a web application. Python provides a built-in `json` module that makes it easy to work with JSON data.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to convert a Python dictionary into a JSON file using Python.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, you should have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official Python website: `https://www.python.org/downloads/`.

## Steps to Convert a Dictionary into a JSON File

1. Import the `json` module:

```python
import json
```

2. Create a Python dictionary:

```python
data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
```

3. Specify the file path where you want to save the JSON file:

```python
file_path = "data.json"
```

4. Open the file in write mode (`"w"`):

```python
with open(file_path, "w") as json_file:
  # TODO: Convert the dictionary to JSON and write it to the file
```

5. Convert the dictionary into JSON using the `json.dump()` function and write it to the file:

```python
with open(file_path, "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(data, json_file)
```

With these steps, you can convert a dictionary into a JSON file using Python.

## Complete Example

Here's the complete example of converting a dictionary into a JSON file:

```python
import json

data = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

file_path = "data.json"

with open(file_path, "w") as json_file:
    json.dump(data, json_file)
```

Save this Python code to a file, run it, and you will have a JSON file `data.json` in the specified file path.

## Summary

In this tutorial, you learned how to convert a Python dictionary into a JSON file using Python's built-in `json` module. This can be useful when you need to store data in a JSON format or send data to a web server that requires JSON data.
