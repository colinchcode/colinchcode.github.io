Monitoring and ensuring the success of your SQL database backups is crucial for maintaining data integrity and minimizing the risk of data loss. By setting up a monitoring and alerting system, you can be notified promptly if any backups fail, allowing you to take immediate action to resolve the issue.

In this article, we'll walk you through the steps to monitor and alert on failed SQL database backups using a combination of SQL Server Agent alerts and email notifications.

## Step 1: Create a SQL Server Agent Alert

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
2. Connect to the SQL Server instance hosting the database you want to monitor.
3. In the Object Explorer, expand SQL Server Agent and Jobs.
4. Right-click on Alerts and select "New Alert".
5. In the "New Alert" dialog, specify a name for the alert, such as "Backup Failure Alert".
6. In the "Type" section, select "SQL Server performance condition alert".
7. In the "Performance condition" section, set the following conditions:
   - Object: SQLServer:Databases
   - Counter: Errors/Sec
   - Instance: [Your Database Name]
   - Alert if counter: Greater than or equal to the value of 1
8. In the "Response" section, select "Execute a job" and choose the job responsible for your backup.
9. Click "OK" to save the alert.

## Step 2: Configure Email Notifications

1. In SQL Server Management Studio, right-click on SQL Server Agent and select "Properties".
2. Navigate to the "Alert System" tab.
3. Check the "Enable mail profile" option and select the mail profile you want to use.
4. Specify the email address for the operator who will receive the notifications.
5. Click "OK" to save the changes.

## Step 3: Test the Alert

To test if the alert and email notifications are working correctly, intentionally create a backup failure. You can do this by temporarily stopping the backup job or causing it to fail.

Once the backup failure occurs, the SQL Server Agent alert will trigger and execute the specified job. As a result, an email notification will be sent to the designated operator, alerting them about the backup failure.

## Conclusion

By setting up monitoring and alerting for failed SQL database backups, you can proactively address any backup issues and safeguard your data. This preventive measure helps to ensure the availability and integrity of your SQL databases.
