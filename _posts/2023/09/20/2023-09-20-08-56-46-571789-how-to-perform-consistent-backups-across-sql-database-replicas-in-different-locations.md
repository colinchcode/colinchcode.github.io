In a distributed SQL database environment where database replicas are spread across multiple locations, ensuring consistent backups becomes crucial. In this blog post, we will discuss a few strategies to perform consistent backups across SQL database replicas in different locations.

## 1. Synchronous Replication

Synchronous replication ensures that each transaction is committed on both the primary database and the replica before it is considered complete. This ensures that the replica is always up-to-date and in sync with the primary database. By using synchronous replication, you can create backups from any replica while ensuring data consistency.

To perform backups using synchronous replication, follow these steps:

1. Identify the replica that is geographically closest to the backup location.
2. Suspend replication temporarily on the chosen replica to prevent any changes during the backup process.
3. Take a backup of the database from the chosen replica.
4. Resume replication on the replica once the backup is completed.

Using synchronous replication ensures that the backup is consistent with the primary database, as all pending transactions will be committed before the backup is taken.

## 2. Transaction Log Shipping

Transaction log shipping is another strategy to perform consistent backups across SQL database replicas. In this approach, transaction logs are periodically shipped from the primary database to the replicas, keeping them up-to-date with the latest changes.

To perform backups using transaction log shipping, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that transaction log backups are being taken regularly on the primary database.
2. Ship the transaction log backups to the replicas using a secure and reliable method, such as secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) or cloud storage.
3. Once the transaction log backups are available on the replicas, take backups using those transaction logs.

By shipping transaction logs to the replicas, you ensure that the backups are consistent with the primary database. However, it's important to note that there might be a slight delay between the primary database and the replicas due to the time taken for the transaction logs to be shipped.

## Conclusion

Performing consistent backups across SQL database replicas in different locations is crucial for data protection and disaster recovery. By leveraging synchronous replication or transaction log shipping, you can ensure that your backups are consistent with the primary database while maintaining data integrity.
