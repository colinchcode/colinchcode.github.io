Memory leaks can be a common issue in iOS development, leading to poor performance and crashing apps. One way to prevent memory leaks is by properly managing resources using strong and weak references. In Swift, guard statements can be a powerful tool for ensuring that resources are cleaned up correctly and preventing memory leaks.

## What are memory leaks?

A memory leak occurs when an object is no longer needed but is still being retained in memory. This can happen when there is a strong reference cycle, where objects reference each other and create a cycle that prevents them from being deallocated. Over time, this can lead to excessive memory usage and cause app crashes.

## Using guard statements to prevent memory leaks

1. **Weak references**: In order to break strong reference cycles, it's important to use weak references to capture self inside closures or blocks. A weak reference does not own the object it points to, and it automatically becomes nil when the referenced object is deallocated.

    ```swift
    class MyViewController: UIViewController {
        var closure: (() -> Void)?

        override func viewDidLoad() {
            super.viewDidLoad()

            closure = { [weak self] in
                guard let self = self else { return }

                // Perform actions with self
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    In the example above, the closure captures a weak reference to `self`, breaking the potential strong reference cycle. The guard statement checks if `self` is still valid, and if not, it simply returns without performing any further actions.

2. **Unowned references**: Similar to weak references, unowned references also do not own the object they point to. However, unlike weak references, unowned references are assumed to always have a valid value. If you're sure that the referenced object will always be available, you can use unowned references instead of weak references.

    ```swift
    class MyObject {
        var completion: (() -> Void)?

        init() {
            completion = { [unowned self] in
                // Perform actions with self
            }
        }

        deinit {
            // Clean up any resources
        }
    }
    ```

    In this example, the `completion` closure captures an unowned reference to `self`, assuming that `self` will always be available. However, be cautious when using unowned references, as they can result in crashes if the referenced object is deallocated.

## Conclusion

Memory leaks can be a significant issue in Swift development, but with proper resource management and the use of guard statements, you can prevent them from occurring. By using weak and unowned references within closures and blocks, and checking their validity with guard statements, you can ensure that memory is freed up appropriately and avoid the negative impact of memory leaks on your iOS apps.
