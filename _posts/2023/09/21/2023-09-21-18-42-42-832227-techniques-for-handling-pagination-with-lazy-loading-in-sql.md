Pagination is a common requirement in web applications where you need to display a large amount of data in smaller, more manageable chunks. Lazy loading is a technique that allows you to load data dynamically as the user scrolls or navigates through the pages, reducing the initial load time and improving the user experience.

In SQL, there are several techniques you can use to implement pagination with lazy loading. Let's explore some of these techniques:

## OFFSET and FETCH
The OFFSET and FETCH clauses are part of the ANSI SQL standard and are supported by most modern databases. These clauses allow you to skip a certain number of rows and fetch a specified number of rows from the result set. Here's an example using OFFSET and FETCH in SQL Server:

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM MyTable
ORDER BY SomeColumn
OFFSET 10 ROWS FETCH NEXT 5 ROWS ONLY;
```

This query skips the first 10 rows and retrieves the next 5 rows from the result set. You can use variables to control the offset and fetch values dynamically.

## ROW_NUMBER()
Another common technique is to use the ROW_NUMBER() function to assign a row number to each record in the result set. You can then filter the rows based on the row number to implement pagination. Here's an example using ROW_NUMBER() in PostgreSQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY SomeColumn) AS row_num
  FROM MyTable
) AS subquery
WHERE row_num BETWEEN 11 AND 15;
```

In this query, the inner subquery assigns a row number to each record ordered by a specific column. The outer query then filters the rows based on the row number, retrieving rows 11 to 15.

## Cursors
Cursors provide a way to iterate through a result set one row at a time. You can use cursors to implement pagination by fetching a fixed number of rows at a time and keeping track of the current position. While cursors can be useful, they may introduce performance implications, especially when dealing with large result sets. Here's an example using cursors in SQL Server:

```sql
DECLARE @Offset INT = 10;
DECLARE @FetchSize INT = 5;
DECLARE @RowNum INT = 0;

DECLARE MyCursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT *
FROM MyTable
ORDER BY SomeColumn;

OPEN MyCursor;

FETCH NEXT FROM MyCursor INTO @Variable1, @Variable2, ...

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0 AND @RowNum < @Offset + @FetchSize
BEGIN
  IF @RowNum >= @Offset
  BEGIN
    -- Display or process the fetched row here
  END

  SET @RowNum = @RowNum + 1;

  FETCH NEXT FROM MyCursor INTO @Variable1, @Variable2, ...
END

CLOSE MyCursor;
DEALLOCATE MyCursor;
```

In this example, the cursor fetches a fixed number of rows at a time and processes them based on the current position.

## Conclusion
Handling pagination with lazy loading in SQL requires careful consideration of the specific database and syntax you are using. The OFFSET and FETCH clauses, ROW_NUMBER() function, and cursors are just a few techniques you can utilize. Choose the technique that best suits your database and application requirements.
