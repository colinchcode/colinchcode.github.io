In SQL, tablespaces are used to organize and manage the physical storage of database objects. By default, all database objects are stored in a tablespace called "SYSTEM". However, there are cases where you may need to create and work with multiple tablespaces, each stored on a different file system or mount point.

## Creating a Tablespace on a Specific File System

To create a new tablespace on a specific file system or mount point, you can use the `CREATE TABLESPACE` statement in SQL. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE TABLESPACE tablespace_name
DATAFILE 'file_path' SIZE size_in_bytes
```

In this example, `tablespace_name` is the name you choose for your tablespace, `file_path` is the path on the file system where the data file will be created, and `size_in_bytes` is the size of the data file in bytes.

## Moving an Existing Tablespace to a Different File System

If you already have a tablespace and want to move it to a different file system or mount point, you can use the `ALTER TABLESPACE` statement in SQL. Here's how you can do it:

```sql
ALTER TABLESPACE tablespace_name
SET LOCATION 'new_file_path'
```

In this statement, `tablespace_name` is the name of the tablespace to be moved, and `new_file_path` is the new path on the file system where the tablespace will be stored.

## Switching a Tablespace to a Different Mount Point

If you want to switch a tablespace to a different mount point without physically moving the data file, you can use symbolic links. Here's an example of how you can achieve this:

1. Create a symbolic link that points to the desired mount point:

```shell
$ ln -s /new/mount/point /current/mount/point
```

2. Update the data file path of the tablespace to point to the symbolic link:

```sql
ALTER TABLESPACE tablespace_name
SET LOCATION '/current/mount/point/datafile_name'
```

In this example, `tablespace_name` is the name of the tablespace, and `datafile_name` is the name of the data file within the tablespace.

## Conclusion

Working with multiple tablespaces and managing their file systems and mount points can provide flexibility and better organization in your SQL environment. By creating tablespaces on specific file systems, moving tablespaces to different file systems, or switching tablespaces between mount points using symbolic links, you can effectively manage the storage of your database objects.
