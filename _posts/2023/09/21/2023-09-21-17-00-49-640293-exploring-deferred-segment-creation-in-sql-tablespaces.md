When working with SQL tablespaces, one important feature to consider is deferred segment creation. This feature can have a significant impact on performance and storage utilization in your database. In this blog post, we will explore what deferred segment creation is, how it works, and the benefits it offers.

## What is Deferred Segment Creation?

Deferred segment creation is a feature introduced in Oracle Database 11g that allows you to postpone the creation of segments for individual objects within a tablespace. Segments are the storage structures used to hold data for tables, indexes, and other database objects.

By deferring segment creation, you can reduce the amount of storage space used initially when creating objects. Rather than allocating the full space upfront, Oracle Database will allocate space on-demand as data is inserted into the object.

## How Does Deferred Segment Creation Work?

When you create a table or an index, and **deferred_segment_creation** is enabled for the tablespace, Oracle will not allocate any space for segments initially. Instead, it will create a placeholder entry in the data dictionary to represent the object. This entry includes information about the object but does not consume any storage space.

As data is inserted into the object, Oracle will allocate space for segments dynamically, as needed. This on-demand allocation reduces wasted space caused by reserving too much space upfront for objects that may not require all of it.

## Benefits of Deferred Segment Creation:

### 1. Reduced Initial Storage Requirements

By deferring segment creation, you can significantly reduce the initial storage requirements for objects within a tablespace. This is particularly useful for tables or indexes with large amounts of empty space or tables with low initial data volume.

### 2. Improved Performance

Since Oracle does not allocate space for segments until they are actually required, the process of creating objects becomes faster. This can lead to improved performance when creating tables or indexes, especially in scenarios where a large number of objects need to be created in parallel.

### 3. Efficient Use of Storage Space

Deferred segment creation ensures efficient utilization of storage space by allocating space as needed. This prevents unnecessary allocation of space for objects that may never use it entirely. It helps to optimize storage utilization within a tablespace, especially in situations where data growth is uncertain or unpredictable.

## Conclusion

Deferred segment creation is a valuable feature in SQL tablespaces that can provide significant benefits in terms of storage efficiency and performance. By postponing segment creation until needed, you can reduce initial storage requirements, improve object creation speed, and optimize storage space utilization. When working with Oracle Database, consider enabling deferred segment creation in tablespaces to take advantage of these benefits.
