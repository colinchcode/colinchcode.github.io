Schema synchronization is an essential requirement for any database cluster to ensure consistent data across multiple nodes. In this blog post, we will discuss how to implement automated schema synchronization in SQL Galera Cluster, a popular multi-master database replication solution.

## What is SQL Galera Cluster?

SQL Galera Cluster is a synchronous multi-master replication solution for MySQL and MariaDB databases. It combines the benefits of both synchronous replication for high availability and multi-master replication for read scalability. Galera Cluster allows you to write to any node and synchronously replicate data across all nodes in the cluster.

## Need for Schema Synchronization

In a Galera Cluster environment, every write operation is instantly applied to all nodes. However, schema changes are executed on a single node and then need to be synchronized across all other nodes. Failing to sync schemas can lead to inconsistent data or even cluster-wide failures.

Manually synchronizing schema changes across nodes can be complex, error-prone, and time-consuming. Therefore, automating this process is vital to simplify operations and ensure accuracy.

## Introducing ClusterControl

ClusterControl is a leading database management and monitoring system that simplifies the deployment, configuration, management, and monitoring of SQL Galera Cluster and other database technologies. One of its critical features is automated schema synchronization.

## Enable Automated Schema Synchronization

To enable auto schema synchronization in ClusterControl, follow these steps:

1. Install and configure ClusterControl on your management node.

2. Add your Galera Cluster architecture to ClusterControl by providing the necessary details.

3. Once your cluster is added, navigate to your cluster's overview page and click on the "Manage and Monitor" button.

4. From the menu on the left, select "Schema Manager."

5. In the Schema Manager, you will find options to synchronize your schema automatically or manually. Choose the automatic synchronization option.

6. ClusterControl will detect the schema changes executed on one node and apply them to all other nodes, ensuring data consistency.

7. Set the synchronization interval according to your requirements. This determines how often ClusterControl checks for schema changes to synchronize.

8. Save the configuration, and ClusterControl will take over the responsibility of automatically synchronizing your schemas across your Galera Cluster.

That's it! You have successfully implemented automated schema synchronization in your SQL Galera Cluster using ClusterControl.

## Conclusion

Automated schema synchronization in SQL Galera Cluster is crucial to ensure data consistency and simplify database administration tasks. By using ClusterControl's schema management feature, you can automate the process of synchronizing schemas across all nodes in your cluster, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.

With ClusterControl, you can focus on managing and optimizing your Galera Cluster, while it takes care of the tedious schema synchronization tasks, making your database operations more efficient and reliable.
