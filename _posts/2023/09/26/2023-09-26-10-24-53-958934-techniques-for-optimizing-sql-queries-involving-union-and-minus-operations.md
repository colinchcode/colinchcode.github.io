When working with SQL queries that involve UNION and MINUS operations, it is essential to optimize these queries to ensure efficient performance. In this blog post, we will explore some techniques to improve the execution time and resource utilization of such queries.

## 1. Use UNION ALL instead of UNION

When combining the results of two or more SELECT statements using UNION, the database engine performs a distinct operation to remove duplicate rows. However, this operation can be costly, especially when dealing with large data sets. To optimize the query, consider using UNION ALL instead of UNION if you don't need to eliminate duplicates.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table2;
```

By using UNION ALL, you instruct the database engine to combine the results of the SELECT statements without removing duplicate rows. This can significantly improve the performance of the query, especially if the number of duplicate rows is low or negligible.

## 2. Minimize column selection

Selecting only the necessary columns in your query can tremendously optimize its execution time. Rather than selecting all columns from the tables involved in the UNION or MINUS operation, **explicitly specify the required columns** in your SELECT statements.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
UNION
SELECT column3, column4
FROM table2;
```

By restricting the selection to only necessary columns, you reduce the amount of data the database engine needs to handle, leading to improved query performance.

**Note:** If you need to perform additional filtering or sorting on the combined results, you can wrap the UNION or MINUS query inside a subquery and perform those operations outside the main query.

## 3. Ensure proper indexing

Like any other SQL query, optimizing queries involving UNION and MINUS operations requires appropriate indexing. Analyze the execution plans and identify the columns used in JOIN or WHERE clauses and apply relevant indexes.

For example, if your query joins two large tables using a common column, create an index on that column to speed up the join operation.

## 4. Use appropriate UNION or MINUS operation

Depending on the scenario, you might need to choose between using UNION or MINUS operation. UNION is used to combine the results of two SELECT statements, while MINUS returns distinct rows from the first SELECT statement that are not present in the second SELECT statement.

Ensure you are using the correct operation that matches your desired outcome. Using the wrong operation might result in unnecessary processing and potentially slower query performance.

By following these techniques, you can optimize SQL queries involving UNION and MINUS operations for better performance and resource utilization. Remember to analyze execution plans, choose the right operation, and use proper indexing to fine-tune your queries.
