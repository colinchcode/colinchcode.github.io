When working with SQL databases, you may come across situations where you need to combine the result set of multiple queries. This can be achieved using the UNION or UNION ALL operators in SQL. However, as the number of union operations increases, the performance of your query can be impacted. In this article, we will explore some techniques to optimize SQL queries with multiple UNION or UNION ALL operations.

## 1. Use UNION ALL when possible

The UNION operator removes duplicates from the result set, while the UNION ALL operator retains all rows, including duplicates. If your query does not require duplicate elimination, using UNION ALL instead of UNION can significantly improve performance. This is because the database engine doesn't have to perform the extra step of identifying and removing duplicates.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2
UNION ALL
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table3
```

## 2. Optimize individual queries

Even though UNION or UNION ALL combines multiple queries, optimizing each individual query can have a positive impact on the overall performance. Ensure that each query is using appropriate indexes and that the necessary join conditions are present. This helps in reducing the execution time of each subquery before combining them.

## 3. Use UNION inside subqueries

Instead of using multiple UNION operations in the main query, you can use UNION inside subqueries to combine smaller result sets. This approach can help improve performance by reducing the number of rows involved in each union operation.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM (
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2
) subquery
```

## 4. Consider temporary tables or views

If you are dealing with complex queries involving multiple UNION operations, it might be beneficial to create temporary tables or views for intermediate result sets. This approach allows you to simplify the main query and can improve performance by reducing the number of union operations performed in a single query.

## 5. Use UNION sparingly

While UNION and UNION ALL can be powerful tools for combining data, it's important to use them sparingly. If possible, consider alternative approaches like JOINs or subqueries to achieve the desired result. Analyze your query requirements and data model to determine if using UNION is the most efficient solution.

In conclusion, optimizing SQL queries with multiple UNION or UNION ALL operations involves using UNION ALL when duplicate elimination is not necessary, optimizing individual queries, utilizing UNION inside subqueries, considering temporary tables or views, and using UNION sparingly. By applying these techniques, you can improve the performance of your SQL queries and enhance the overall efficiency of your database operations.
