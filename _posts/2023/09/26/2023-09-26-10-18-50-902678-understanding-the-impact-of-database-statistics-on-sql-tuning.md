## Introduction

SQL tuning is an important aspect of database performance optimization. When a SQL query is executed in a database, the database optimizer uses statistics to determine the most efficient execution plan. Database statistics provide information about the distribution and characteristics of data in a database table or index. In this blog post, we will explore the impact of database statistics on SQL tuning and how to optimize them for better performance.

## Why Are Database Statistics Important?

**Database statistics** play a crucial role in query optimization and execution. They provide valuable insights into the size, distribution, and uniqueness of data in database objects. Database statistics enable the query optimizer to estimate the selectivity and cardinality of query predicates, which helps in choosing the most efficient execution plan.

## Types of Database Statistics

There are several types of database statistics that can be collected for SQL tuning purposes. These include:

1. **Table Statistics**: These statistics provide information about the number of rows, average row size, and the number of blocks used by a table.
2. **Column Statistics**: Column statistics provide insights into the distribution of data values within a column, such as the minimum and maximum values, as well as the number of distinct values.
3. **Index Statistics**: These statistics provide information about the uniqueness of index keys and the number of leaf blocks used by an index.

## Impact of Database Statistics on SQL Tuning

Accurate database statistics are crucial for the query optimizer to generate an optimal execution plan. If statistics are outdated or missing, the optimizer may make incorrect assumptions about the data distribution, leading to poor query performance. Here are some of the ways in which database statistics impact SQL tuning:

1. **Query Optimization**: The query optimizer uses database statistics to estimate the cost of various execution plans and chooses the one with the lowest cost. Accurate statistics help in making informed decisions and generating efficient query plans.
2. **Index Selection**: Database statistics play a vital role in index selection. The optimizer relies on index statistics to determine whether using an index will result in improved query performance or not. Outdated or incorrect statistics can lead to suboptimal index usage.
3. **Predicate Selectivity**: Statistics enable the optimizer to estimate the selectivity of query predicates, i.e., the percentage of rows that satisfy a particular condition. Accurate selectivity estimates help in choosing the right access path and join order for query execution.
4. **Join Cardinality**: Join operations can be costly if not planned properly. Database statistics help in estimating the number of rows returned by a join operation, facilitating the choice of an efficient join algorithm.

## Optimizing Database Statistics

To ensure optimal SQL tuning, it is essential to keep database statistics up-to-date. Here are some best practices to optimize database statistics:

1. **Regular Statistics Gathering**: Schedule regular statistics gathering for database objects. This can be done using the built-in statistics gathering job or custom scripts. Regular statistics gathering helps in maintaining accurate and up-to-date statistics.
2. **Histograms**: Create histograms for columns with skewed data distributions. Histograms provide detailed distribution information, allowing the optimizer to make more accurate estimates.
3. **Multicolumn Statistics**: When dealing with queries involving multiple columns, consider creating multicolumn statistics. These statistics capture the correlation between columns, helping the optimizer make better decisions for query optimization.
4. **Monitoring and Refreshing Statistics**: Monitor the freshness of database statistics and refresh them whenever significant changes occur in the data distribution. This can be automated using database alerts or manual monitoring.

## Conclusion

Database statistics are a critical component of SQL tuning. Accurate and up-to-date statistics help the query optimizer make informed decisions for generating optimal execution plans. By understanding the impact of database statistics on SQL tuning and following best practices for maintaining and optimizing statistics, you can significantly improve database performance and query execution speed.
