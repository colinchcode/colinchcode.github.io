Virtual LANs, or VLANs, are a way of logically dividing a physical network into multiple smaller broadcast domains. VLANs allow for improved network performance, better security, and easier network management. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement VLANs using Python.

## Introduction to VLANs

A VLAN is created by assigning specific switch ports or groups of ports to a VLAN ID. Switch ports in the same VLAN can communicate with each other directly, while ports in different VLANs require a router or a Layer 3 switch to facilitate communication between them.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you'll need:

- A computer with Python installed
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts

## Implementation

We will use a Python library called `pyshark` to capture live network traffic and filter packets based on VLAN tags. `pyshark` is a wrapper for the popular `tshark` tool, which is used to analyze network traffic.

To install `pyshark`, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```shell
pip install pyshark
```

Once `pyshark` is installed, let's dive into the implementation. We will write a simple Python script that captures network traffic and filters packets based on VLAN tags. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import pyshark

def sniff_packets():
    capture = pyshark.LiveCapture(interface='eth0')
    
    for packet in capture.sniff_continuously():
        if 'VLAN' in packet:
            vlan_id = packet['VLAN'].vlan
            print(f"Packet captured with VLAN ID: {vlan_id}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sniff_packets()
```

In the above code, we import the `pyshark` library and define a function called `sniff_packets` that performs the packet sniffing.

The `LiveCapture` class from `pyshark` is used to capture live network traffic. We specify the network interface (e.g., `'eth0'`) on which we want to capture packets.

Within the `sniff_packets` function, we use a `for` loop to iterate over each captured packet. We then check if the packet contains a VLAN tag by checking if `'VLAN'` is present in the packet object.

If a VLAN tag is found, we extract the VLAN ID using the `vlan` attribute from the `'VLAN'` object. Finally, we print the VLAN ID to the console.

To run the script, save it as `vlan_sniffer.py` and execute the following command:

```shell
python vlan_sniffer.py
```

You should see the VLAN IDs of captured packets being printed to the console.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to implement VLANs using Python. We used the `pyshark` library to capture live network traffic and filter packets based on VLAN tags. By understanding and implementing VLANs in your network infrastructure, you can achieve better performance, security, and network management capabilities.

Remember to experiment and extend the code to meet your specific requirements. Happy networking!
