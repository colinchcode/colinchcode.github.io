When it comes to optimizing SQL queries, dealing with multiple NOT conditions can be a challenging task. However, there are several techniques that you can employ to improve the performance of your SQL queries when using multiple NOT conditions.

## 1. Use De Morgan's Laws

De Morgan's Laws state that the negation of a logical conjunction (AND) is equivalent to the logical disjunction (OR) of the negations of the individual terms. Likewise, the negation of a logical disjunction (OR) is equivalent to the logical conjunction (AND) of the negations of the individual terms.

By applying De Morgan's Laws, you can rewrite queries with multiple NOT conditions into queries with multiple AND conditions, which can often have better performance.

For example, instead of writing:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT condition1 AND NOT condition2 AND NOT condition3;
```

You can rewrite the query using De Morgan's Laws as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition1 = 0 AND condition2 = 0 AND condition3 = 0;
```

This can help the query optimizer make better use of indexes and improve query performance.

## 2. Use EXISTS or NOT EXISTS instead of NOT conditions

Another technique to consider is using the EXISTS or NOT EXISTS operators instead of multiple NOT conditions. 

For example, instead of writing:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT condition1 AND NOT condition2;
```

You can rewrite the query using EXISTS as:

```sql
SELECT * FROM table WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition1 OR condition2);
```

This can improve query performance by using efficient subquery execution plans.

## Conclusion

Optimizing SQL queries with multiple NOT conditions requires careful consideration and the use of appropriate techniques. By applying De Morgan's Laws and considering alternatives like EXISTS or NOT EXISTS, you can improve the performance of your queries significantly.
