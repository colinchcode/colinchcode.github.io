Query performance is crucial when working with large databases. Slow-running SQL queries can significantly impact the overall performance of an application. In such cases, query tuning becomes essential to improve response times and ensure optimal database performance.

One effective approach to SQL tuning is query rewriting. Query rewriting involves restructuring or modifying the original SQL query to achieve better execution plans and faster results. Here are some common query rewriting techniques that can be used for SQL tuning.

## 1. Subquery Unnesting

Subqueries are often used to simplify complex queries, but they can lead to poor performance if not handled properly. Subquery unnesting involves transforming correlated subqueries or subqueries in the SELECT clause into join operations or temporary tables.

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE OrderStatus = 'Shipped');
```

Using subquery unnesting, the query can be rewritten as:

```sql
SELECT Customer.*
FROM Customer
JOIN Orders ON Customer.CustomerID = Orders.CustomerID
WHERE OrderStatus = 'Shipped';
```

This rewriting technique can reduce the number of nested queries and improve performance by leveraging the benefits of joins or temporary tables.

## 2. Query Decomposition

Query decomposition involves breaking down a complex query into multiple simpler queries and combining their results. This technique is useful when a single query involves multiple tables with complex join conditions and filters.

Consider the following example:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders WHERE OrderStatus = 'Shipped')
  AND CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Payments WHERE PaymentStatus = 'Completed');
```

Using query decomposition, the query can be rewritten as:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE CustomerID IN (
  SELECT Orders.CustomerID
  FROM Orders
  WHERE OrderStatus = 'Shipped'
)
AND CustomerID IN (
  SELECT Payments.CustomerID
  FROM Payments
  WHERE PaymentStatus = 'Completed'
);
```

By decomposing the original query into separate subqueries, it becomes easier for the database optimizer to generate efficient query plans, potentially improving performance.
