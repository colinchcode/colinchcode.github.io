## Introduction
SQL Galera Cluster is a popular open-source database clustering solution that provides high availability and scalability for MySQL and MariaDB databases. Like any software, SQL Galera Cluster requires periodic restarts and upgrades to ensure optimal performance and security. However, performing these operations in a production environment can be challenging, as it may lead to downtime or data inconsistencies if not executed properly. In this blog post, we will discuss how to perform rolling restarts and upgrades in SQL Galera Cluster to minimize downtime and ensure a seamless transition.

## Rolling Restarts
A rolling restart is the process of restarting cluster nodes one-by-one, allowing the cluster to maintain availability during the restart operation. This technique ensures that the database service remains accessible to clients while avoiding complete downtime.

To perform a rolling restart in SQL Galera Cluster, follow these steps:

1. **Step 1: Check Cluster Status**  
   Before starting the restart process, it is essential to verify the cluster's health and ensure that all nodes are in sync. Use the following command to check the cluster status:
   
   ````sql
   SHOW STATUS LIKE 'wsrep_cluster_size';
   ````

   This command will return the number of active cluster nodes.

2. **Step 2: Take One Node Offline**  
   Select one node at a time and take it offline by stopping the database service using the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, to stop MariaDB service on Linux, you can use the following command:
   
   ```bash
   systemctl stop mariadb
   ```

3. **Step 3: Monitor Cluster Status**  
   While the node is offline, monitor the cluster status using the command mentioned in Step 1. Ensure that the cluster size drops by one, indicating the offline node.

4. **Step 4: Restart Node**  
   After confirming that the cluster size has decreased by one, proceed to restart the offline node. Start the database service using the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, to start MariaDB service on Linux, you can use the following command:

   ```bash
   systemctl start mariadb
   ```

5. **Step 5: Validate Node Rejoining**  
   Once the restarted node is up and running, monitor the cluster status to confirm that the node has rejoined the cluster. You can use the command from Step 1 to validate the cluster size.

6. **Step 6: Repeat Steps 2-5 for Remaining Nodes**  
   Repeat steps 2 to 5 for all the remaining nodes in the cluster. This will ensure that each node is restarted without affecting the overall availability of the database service.

By following these steps, you can perform a rolling restart in SQL Galera Cluster without significant downtime or service interruption.

## Upgrading SQL Galera Cluster
Performing upgrades is crucial to keeping your SQL Galera Cluster up to date with the latest features, bug fixes, and security patches. Upgrades typically involve updating the Galera software, MySQL/MariaDB versions, or both. To upgrade your SQL Galera Cluster, consider the following steps:

1. **Step 1: Backup Database**  
   Before starting the upgrade process, it is essential to create a backup of your database. This step provides a safety net to revert in case any issues arise during the upgrade process.

2. **Step 2: Read Upgrade Documentation**  
   Refer to the official documentation of SQL Galera Cluster or your specific distribution for detailed instructions on performing upgrades. Different versions and distributions may have specific requirements or steps.

3. **Step 3: Perform a Rolling Restart**  
   Before the upgrade, it is recommended to perform a rolling restart as described in the previous section. This ensures a smooth transition and minimizes downtime.

4. **Step 4: Stop the Cluster**  
   Once all nodes have been restarted, stop the entire cluster by stopping the database service on each node. Ensure that all nodes are completely offline before proceeding to the next step.

5. **Step 5: Perform the Upgrade**  
   Follow the specific upgrade instructions provided in the documentation to upgrade the Galera software or MySQL/MariaDB version, depending on your requirements. Make sure to carefully follow all the steps and prerequisites to avoid any issues.

6. **Step 6: Validate Upgrade**  
   Once the upgrade process is complete, start the database service on each node and monitor the cluster status. Ensure that all nodes successfully join the cluster and validate that the upgrade has been applied.

7. **Step 7: Test and Verify**  
   After the upgrade, thoroughly test your database application to ensure it operates as expected. Verify that all data is intact and that there are no errors or compatibility issues.

Performing rolling restarts and upgrades in SQL Galera Cluster requires careful planning and execution. By following the steps outlined in this blog post, you can minimize downtime, maintain high availability, and keep your cluster up to date with the latest features and security patches.
