In SQL, pattern matching is a powerful technique used to search for specific patterns within strings or values. The two commonly used operators for pattern matching in SQL are **LIKE** and **REGEXP**. These operators allow you to search for patterns using wildcards and regular expressions, respectively.

## LIKE Operator

The **LIKE** operator is used to match patterns within a string by using wildcard characters. The wildcard characters used in conjunction with the **LIKE** operator are:

- **%**: Matches any sequence of characters.
- **_**: Matches any single character.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the **LIKE** operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE '%shirt%';
```

This query will return all products with "shirt" anywhere in their name.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name LIKE 't_shirt';
```

This query will return all products with names like "t-shirt", "T_Shirt", etc.

## REGEXP Operator

The **REGEXP** operator, short for regular expression, allows you to perform advanced pattern matching using regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful patterns that can match complex patterns within strings.

Here's an example that demonstrates the usage of the **REGEXP** operator:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name REGEXP '^[A-Za-z]+$';
```

This query will return all products with names that consist only of alphabetic characters.

```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE name REGEXP '^(de|un)?zip$';
```

This query will return all products with names like "zip" or "unzip", but also "dezip".

By using regular expressions, you can create complex pattern matching queries to search for specific patterns within your data.

## Conclusion

Pattern matching is an essential feature in SQL, and by utilizing the **LIKE** and **REGEXP** operators, you can perform advanced pattern matching to search for specific patterns within your data. Whether you need to find specific characters, words, or sequences, pattern matching with these operators can help you accomplish your goals.
