## Method 1: Using the DROP TABLE Statement

The simplest way to drop multiple tables is by using the `DROP TABLE` statement. This statement allows you to delete one or more tables in a single query.

To drop multiple tables, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name1, table_name2, ...;
```

For example, let's say we want to drop two tables named "customers" and "orders". Our SQL query would look like this:

```sql
DROP TABLE customers, orders;
```

This statement will delete both tables at once, removing all the data and associated objects.

## Method 2: Using a Stored Procedure

Another approach to dropping multiple tables is by creating a stored procedure. This method provides more flexibility, as you can define the tables to be dropped dynamically.

Here's an example of a stored procedure that drops multiple tables:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE drop_tables()
BEGIN
    DECLARE table_name VARCHAR(255);
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT table_name FROM your_table_list;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

    OPEN cur;

    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH cur INTO table_name;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;

        SET @sql = CONCAT('DROP TABLE ', table_name);
        PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
        EXECUTE stmt;
        DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE cur;
END;
```

In this stored procedure, you need to replace `your_table_list` with a table that contains the names of the tables you want to drop. You can modify this table based on your specific requirements.

Once the stored procedure is created, you can execute it using the following query:

```sql
CALL drop_tables();
```

This will drop all the tables listed in your table list.

## Conclusion

Dropping multiple tables is a helpful skill to have when managing databases. Whether you prefer using the `DROP TABLE` statement or creating a stored procedure, both methods offer efficient ways to remove multiple tables simultaneously.

By utilizing these methods, you can easily clean up your database and remove unnecessary tables. Just remember to double-check your queries before executing them to avoid any unintended table deletions.
