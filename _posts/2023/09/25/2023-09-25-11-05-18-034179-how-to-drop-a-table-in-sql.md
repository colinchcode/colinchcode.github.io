Here is an example code in SQL to drop a table:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` with the name of the table you want to drop. Make sure to use the correct table name to avoid accidentally dropping the wrong table.

Before dropping a table, it is important to note that this action cannot be undone. Dropping a table will remove all the data stored in it. Therefore, it is crucial to take a backup or confirm that you no longer need the table and its data before executing the `DROP TABLE` statement.

Remember to exercise caution when using this command as it permanently removes the table and its associated data from the database.
