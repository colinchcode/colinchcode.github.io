Here are a few examples of how you can use the `DROP TABLE` statement in different scenarios:

### Example 1: Dropping a table

To drop a table, you need to specify the name of the table you want to delete. The syntax for dropping a table is as follows:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

For instance, if you want to delete a table called `customers`, you would execute the following command:

```sql
DROP TABLE customers;
```

### Example 2: Dropping a table only if it exists

Sometimes, you may want to drop a table only if it exists to avoid any errors. To accomplish this, you can use the `IF EXISTS` clause. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS table_name;
```

For example, if you want to drop a table called `orders` only if it exists, you can use the following command:

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS orders;
```

### Example 3: Dropping multiple tables

You can also drop multiple tables in a single `DROP TABLE` statement. Simply list the names of the tables you want to delete, separated by commas. The syntax looks like this:

```sql
DROP TABLE table1, table2, table3;
```

For instance, if you want to drop three tables named `employees`, `departments`, and `salary`, you can execute the following command:

```sql
DROP TABLE employees, departments, salary;
```

Remember to be cautious when using the `DROP TABLE` statement, as it permanently deletes the specified tables and all their associated data. Always double-check your command before executing it.
