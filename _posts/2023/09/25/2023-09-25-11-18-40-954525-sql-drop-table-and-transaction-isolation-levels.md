When working with databases, it is common to need to remove tables that are no longer needed or have become redundant. In SQL, the `DROP TABLE` statement allows you to delete a table and all its associated data from the database. 

Here's an example of how to use the `DROP TABLE` statement:

```sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

Replace `table_name` in the code above with the actual name of the table you want to drop. Be cautious when using this statement as it is irreversible and permanently removes the table and its data.

## Transaction Isolation Levels: Ensuring Data Consistency and Integrity

In a multi-user database environment, ensuring data consistency and integrity is vital. Transaction isolation levels in SQL determine how changes made by one transaction are visible to other concurrent transactions. Understanding these isolation levels is crucial for designing robust and concurrent database applications.

There are different transaction isolation levels in SQL, including:

1. **Read Uncommitted**: This isolation level allows dirty reads, meaning that a transaction can read data modified by other concurrent transactions before they are committed. This level offers the least amount of data consistency and integrity but provides the highest concurrency.

2. **Read Committed**: In this isolation level, a transaction can only read data that has been committed by other transactions. It avoids dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads and phantom reads.

3. **Repeatable Read**: This isolation level guarantees that within a transaction, the same query will return the same result. It prevents non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads, where rows that have been committed by other transactions can be inserted or deleted.

4. **Serializable**: The highest isolation level, `SERIALIZABLE`, ensures that transactions are executed as if they were running one after the other, without any concurrency. It provides full data consistency and integrity by avoiding dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

You can set the transaction isolation level using the appropriate SQL command before starting a transaction. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can use the following statement:

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL read_uncommitted;
```

The choice of transaction isolation level depends on the specific requirements of your application. Opting for a higher isolation level ensures stronger data integrity but potentially sacrifices concurrency.
