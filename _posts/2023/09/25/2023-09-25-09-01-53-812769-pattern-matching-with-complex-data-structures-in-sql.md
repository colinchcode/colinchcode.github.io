# Introduction

Pattern matching in SQL allows you to search for complex data structures such as JSON or XML. This can be incredibly useful when dealing with data that has hierarchical or nested elements. By leveraging SQL's pattern matching capabilities, you can easily extract specific data elements, navigate through complex structures, and apply conditions to filter your results. Let's dive into some examples to highlight how this works.

# JSON Pattern Matching

Suppose you have a table that stores customer information as JSON objects. Each JSON object represents a customer and contains various attributes such as name, email, and address. To perform pattern matching on this data, you can use SQL's JSON functions and operators.

```
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE customer_json->'address'->>'city' LIKE '%York'
```

In this example, we are selecting all customers whose city ends with "York". The `customer_json->'address'->>'city'` syntax allows us to navigate through the nested JSON structure and access the city attribute. We then use the `LIKE` operator to perform the pattern match.

# XML Pattern Matching

Similarly, if you are dealing with XML data, SQL provides functions and operators to perform pattern matching. Let's consider a simplified example where we have a table storing product information as XML.

```
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE product_xml.exist('/products/product[contains(name, "shirt") and price > 10]') = 1
```

In this case, we are selecting all products that contain the word "shirt" in their name and have a price greater than 10. The `product_xml.exist()` function allows us to check the existence of a specific XML pattern within the XML document. We define our pattern using XQuery syntax, combining conditions with logical operators.

# Conclusion

Pattern matching with complex data structures in SQL opens up a wide array of possibilities to filter and extract information from your data efficiently. Whether you're dealing with JSON or XML, SQL provides powerful functions and operators to perform pattern matching. By leveraging these capabilities, you can easily query and manipulate complex data structures for analysis or reporting purposes. So, the next time you have to deal with structured data, consider using SQL's pattern matching features to unlock its full potential.
