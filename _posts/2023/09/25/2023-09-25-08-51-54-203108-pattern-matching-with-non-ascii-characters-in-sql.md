Pattern matching is a powerful technique in SQL that allows us to search for specific patterns within text strings. However, when working with non-ASCII characters, such as characters with accents or diacritical marks, it can sometimes be challenging to accurately match these characters in SQL queries.

In this blog post, we will explore how to effectively perform pattern matching with non-ASCII characters in SQL, ensuring that our queries are able to correctly handle and match these special characters.

## Using UNICODE and LIKE Operators

When dealing with non-ASCII characters, the first approach is to use the `UNICODE` function in combination with the `LIKE` operator. The `UNICODE` function returns the Unicode code point of a character, allowing us to specify the exact code point for matching.

Here is an example of using the `UNICODE` function and `LIKE` operator to match a non-ASCII character:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name LIKE '%ø%' AND UNICODE(name) = UNICODE('ø')
```

In this example, we are searching for products with the character 'ø' in their names. By comparing the Unicode code points of the character in the column and the desired character, we ensure an accurate match.

## Using Regular Expressions

Another approach to pattern matching with non-ASCII characters in SQL is to use regular expressions. Regular expressions provide a powerful way to match complex patterns, including non-ASCII characters.

Most modern database systems support regular expressions in SQL queries. Here is an example of using regular expressions to match non-ASCII characters:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE name ~ '[øØ]'
```

In this example, the regular expression `[øØ]` matches any occurrence of either 'ø' or 'Ø' within the name column. The `~` operator signifies that we are using a regular expression for pattern matching.

## Conclusion

Accurately performing pattern matching with non-ASCII characters in SQL is essential when dealing with multilingual or international data. By using the `UNICODE` function in combination with the `LIKE` operator or by leveraging regular expressions, we can ensure that our queries are able to correctly match non-ASCII characters.

Remember to test your queries thoroughly with different non-ASCII characters to ensure compatibility across various languages and character sets.
