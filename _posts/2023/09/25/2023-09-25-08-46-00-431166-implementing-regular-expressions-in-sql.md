In SQL, regular expressions can be implemented using the `REGEXP_LIKE` function (Oracle) or the `REGEXP` operator (MySQL, PostgreSQL). These functions enable you to perform pattern matching operations within your SQL queries.

Here's an example of how you can use regular expressions in SQL:

```sql
-- Oracle Syntax
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(column_name, 'pattern');

-- MySQL and PostgreSQL Syntax
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name REGEXP 'pattern';
```

In the above code snippet, replace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to search within and `table_name` with the name of the table. The `'pattern'` should be replaced with the specific regular expression pattern you want to match.

Let's say we have a table called `employees` with a column `email` that stores email addresses. We want to retrieve all email addresses that end with `.com`. We can use the following SQL query to achieve this:

```sql
SELECT email
FROM employees
WHERE email REGEXP '.+\.com$';
```

In the above example, the regular expression `'.+\.com$'` matches any character one or more times (`.`), followed by a literal dot (`\.`), and ends with `com` (`$`). The `+` and `.` are special characters in regular expressions and need to be escaped with a backslash `\`.

Using regular expressions in SQL provides a powerful and flexible way to analyze and manipulate text data directly within your database queries. Whether you need to extract specific patterns, perform data validation, or retrieve specific data, regular expressions can significantly enhance your SQL querying capabilities.
