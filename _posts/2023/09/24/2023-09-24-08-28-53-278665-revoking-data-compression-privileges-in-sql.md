In SQL, data compression is a valuable feature that allows you to reduce storage space and improve query performance. However, there may be scenarios where you need to revoke data compression privileges for certain users or tables. In this blog post, we will explore how to revoke data compression privileges in SQL.

## Understanding Data Compression in SQL

Before we dive into revoking data compression privileges, let's briefly understand how data compression works in SQL. Data compression in SQL Server is achieved through page compression or row compression.

Page compression compresses data at the page level, storing the data in a compressed format. This reduces the storage space required and improves disk read and write performance.

Row compression, on the other hand, compresses data at the row level. It eliminates unnecessary spaces and reduces the size of each row, leading to improved query performance.

## Revoking Data Compression Privileges

To revoke data compression privileges in SQL, you can use the `REVOKE` statement along with the appropriate permissions.

Here's an example of how to revoke data compression privileges for a user in SQL Server:

```sql
REVOKE ALTER ON SCHEMA::dbo TO [user_name];
```

In the above example, `ALTER` is the permission that grants the ability to modify table properties, including data compression. Replace `[user_name]` with the actual username you want to revoke the privileges from.

To revoke data compression privileges for a specific table, you can use the `REVOKE` statement as follows:

```sql
REVOKE ALTER ON OBJECT::dbo.table_name TO [user_name];
```

In the above example, replace `table_name` with the actual name of the table for which you want to revoke data compression privileges.

## Checking Data Compression Privileges

To verify whether data compression privileges have been successfully revoked, you can use the `HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME` function. This function allows you to check a user's permissions on a specific object.

Here's an example of how to use the `HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME` function to check if a user has alter permissions on a table:

```sql
SELECT HAS_PERMS_BY_NAME('dbo.table_name', 'OBJECT', 'ALTER') AS Has_Permission;
```

The result of the above query will be 0 (or false) if the user does not have alter permissions.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, we explored how to revoke data compression privileges in SQL. By revoking these privileges, you can control who has the ability to compress data, ensuring data integrity and security. Remember to use the appropriate permissions and regularly monitor and manage the compression settings to optimize storage space and query performance.
