In data analysis or temperature monitoring applications, it is often necessary to calculate the average temperature. SQL provides the **AVG()** function to easily calculate the average of a set of values in a database table.

Here's an example SQL query to calculate the average temperature from a table called `temperature_data`:

```sql
SELECT AVG(temperature) AS average_temperature
FROM temperature_data;
```

In this query, we use the AVG() function to calculate the average of the `temperature` column in the `temperature_data` table. We also use the `AS` keyword to give the result column a name, `average_temperature`.

To calculate the average temperature, simply execute this SQL query against your database.

**Note:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to access the desired table and don't forget to replace `temperature_data` with the actual table name in your database.

By using the AVG() function, you can easily calculate the average temperature and incorporate it into your data analysis or display it in your temperature monitoring application.

To enhance the performance of your SQL query, make sure to create an index on the `temperature` column in the `temperature_data` table if it contains a large number of records. This will help speed up the calculation process.
