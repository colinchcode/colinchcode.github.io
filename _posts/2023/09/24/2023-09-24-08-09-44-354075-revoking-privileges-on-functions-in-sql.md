To begin, let's consider the scenario where a user has been granted execute privileges on a particular function, but we now want to revoke those privileges.

The syntax to revoke privileges on a function is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION function_name(arguments) FROM user_or_role;
```

Here, `function_name` refers to the name of the function you want to revoke privileges on, and `arguments` represents the function's input parameters, if any. The `user_or_role` parameter denotes the user or role from whom you want to revoke the privileges.

For example, let's say we have a function called `calculate_salary` that has been granted execute privileges to a user named 'finance_user'. We want to revoke these privileges. The SQL query to achieve this would be:

```sql
REVOKE EXECUTE ON FUNCTION calculate_salary() FROM finance_user;
```

It's important to note that the user or role specified must have previously been granted the privileges on the function. If the user does not have the required privileges, the revoke operation will not have any effect.

Additionally, it's good practice to periodically review the privileges granted to users and roles in order to maintain a secure database environment. In cases where privileges are no longer needed or the user's role has changed, you should consider revoking those privileges.

By revoking privileges on functions, you can effectively control the access and execution capabilities of users within your SQL environment. This helps ensure that only authorized individuals can manipulate or interact with specific functions, enhancing overall security.
