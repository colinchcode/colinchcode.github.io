In the world of mobile app development, monitoring and optimizing the performance of your app is crucial. One important metric to track is the average response time of the requests made by your mobile app. This can help you identify bottlenecks and optimize the performance of your app.

To find the average response time of mobile app requests, we can use the SQL AVG function. Let's see how it can be done.

## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the SQL query, make sure you have a database set up with a table that stores the request data. The table should have the following columns:

- `request_id`: Unique identifier for each request.
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of when the request was made.
- `response_time`: Time taken to process the request in milliseconds.

## SQL Query
Assuming you have a table named `requests`, we can use the following SQL query to calculate the average response time of mobile app requests:

```sql
SELECT AVG(response_time) AS average_response_time
FROM requests
WHERE <condition>;
```

Replace `<condition>` with any specific conditions you want to apply to filter the requests, such as a particular time range or specific user.

## Example Query
Let's assume we want to find the average response time of all requests made in the last 24 hours. The SQL query would look like this:

```sql
SELECT AVG(response_time) AS average_response_time
FROM requests
WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

## Conclusion
By utilizing the SQL AVG function, you can easily calculate the average response time of mobile app requests. Monitoring this metric regularly can help you identify performance issues and make data-driven decisions to optimize your app's performance.
