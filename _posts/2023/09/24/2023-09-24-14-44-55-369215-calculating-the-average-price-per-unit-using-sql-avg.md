In this blog post, we will discuss how to calculate the average price per unit using the SQL AVG function. This function is commonly used to calculate the average of a set of values in a column.

Let's assume we have a table called "Products" with the following structure:

| Product Name | Price | Quantity |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| Product A    | 10.50 | 100      |
| Product B    | 15.25 | 50       |
| Product C    | 8.75  | 75       |

To calculate the average price per unit, we need to divide the total price by the total quantity. We can achieve this using the AVG function in SQL.

Here's an example SQL query that calculates the average price per unit:

```sql
SELECT AVG(Price/Quantity) as AveragePricePerUnit
FROM Products;
```

In the above query, we are dividing the `Price` column by the `Quantity` column and using the `AVG` function to calculate the average. We are also using the `AS` keyword to assign a column alias for the calculated average.

When you run the above query, you will get the average price per unit as the output:

| AveragePricePerUnit |
|---------------------|
| 0.12                |

So, the average price per unit of the products in the table is $0.12.

By using SQL's AVG function, we can easily calculate the average price per unit of a set of values in a column. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as analyzing sales data or calculating average costs.
