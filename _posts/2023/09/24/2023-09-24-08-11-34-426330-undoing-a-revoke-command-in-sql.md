## Understanding the REVOKE command

Before we dive into the process of undoing a `REVOKE` command, let's quickly recap what the `REVOKE` command does. In SQL, the `REVOKE` command is used to remove the privileges that have been granted to a user or role.

The basic syntax of the `REVOKE` command is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE privilege_name
ON object_name
FROM user_or_role_name;
```

## The GRANT statement to the rescue

To undo a `REVOKE` command and restore the privileges, we will make use of the `GRANT` statement. The `GRANT` statement is used to grant privileges to a user or role in SQL.

The basic syntax of the `GRANT` statement is as follows:

```sql
GRANT privilege_name
ON object_name
TO user_or_role_name;
```

In order to undo a `REVOKE` command, you need to execute a `GRANT` statement with the same privileges and object that were revoked. This will grant the privileges back to the user or role.

## Example Scenario

Let's consider an example scenario where you accidentally revoked the `SELECT` privilege on a table named `employees` from a user named `john`. To undo this `REVOKE` command, you can use the following `GRANT` statement:

```sql
GRANT SELECT
ON employees
TO john;
```

Executing this `GRANT` statement will restore the `SELECT` privilege on the `employees` table for the user `john`.

## Conclusion

Accidentally executing a `REVOKE` command can happen to anyone, but with the help of the `GRANT` statement, it is easy to undo and restore the privileges. Remember to double-check your commands before executing them to avoid any potential mistakes.
