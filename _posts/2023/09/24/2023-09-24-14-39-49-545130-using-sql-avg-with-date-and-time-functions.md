Let's say we have a table called "orders" with columns "order_date" and "total_amount". We want to calculate the average total amount per day. Here's how we can achieve that using SQL's AVG function along with date and time functions:

```sql
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY DATE(order_date);
```

In the above example, we are using the `GROUP BY` clause along with the `DATE()` function to group the average amounts by the date part of the `order_date` column. This allows us to get the average total amount per day.

If you want to calculate the average based on a specific time interval, such as hourly or monthly, you can utilize the appropriate date and time functions accordingly.

For example, to calculate the average amount per hour, you can use `DATEPART` to extract the hour from the `order_date` column:

```sql
SELECT AVG(total_amount) AS average_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY DATEPART(hour, order_date);
```

Similarly, you can use other date and time functions like `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `WEEK`, or `QUARTER` to calculate averages based on different time intervals.

Just remember to adjust the date and time functions based on your specific database system as the syntax may vary slightly.

By leveraging SQL's AVG function along with date and time functions, you can perform calculations on date and time data effectively and efficiently. It allows you to gain insights into average values based on specific time intervals, helping you analyze and understand your data more thoroughly.
