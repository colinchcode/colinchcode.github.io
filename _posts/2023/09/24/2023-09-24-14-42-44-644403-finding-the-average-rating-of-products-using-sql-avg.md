In this blog post, we will explore how to find the average rating of products using the `AVG` function in SQL. This function allows us to calculate the average value of a column across a set of records.

## Understanding the Scenario

Imagine we have a table called `products` in our database that contains information about various products, including their names and ratings. The `rating` column stores the rating value of each product on a scale from 1 to 5.

Our task is to determine the average rating of all the products in the table using SQL.

## Writing the SQL Query

To calculate the average rating using the `AVG` function, we can simply write the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(rating) AS average_rating
FROM products;
```

Let's break down this query:

- The `SELECT` statement selects the calculated average rating value and assigns it an alias `average_rating`.
- The `AVG(rating)` function calculates the average of the `rating` column.
- The `FROM` statement specifies the table `products` from which we want to calculate the average rating.

## Running the Query

After writing the SQL query, we can execute it using any SQL client or command line interface that connects to our database.

Once the query is executed, we will get the average rating of all the products as the result. The result should look something like this:

```
average_rating
--------------
     4.2
```

In this example, the average rating of all the products is 4.2.

## Conclusion

Using the SQL `AVG` function, we can easily calculate the average rating of products stored in a database table. This allows us to quickly analyze and compare the overall rating of products. Whether it's calculating average ratings or performing other calculations, SQL functions are powerful tools for data analysis in relational databases.
