In SQL, it is common to grant privileges to users in order to allow them access to certain database objects or perform specific operations. However, there may be cases where you need to revoke those privileges permanently. This can be necessary when a user's access needs to be permanently restricted or revoked due to security concerns or changes in their role.

To revoke privileges from a user permanently in SQL, you can make use of the `REVOKE` statement. The `REVOKE` statement is used to revoke previously granted privileges from a user.

## Syntax

The basic syntax to revoke privileges from a user permanently is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE privilege [, privilege...]
ON object
FROM user
```

Here, `privilege` refers to the specific privilege you want to revoke, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc. You can specify multiple privileges separated by commas. 

`object` refers to the database object from which you want to revoke privileges. It can be a table, view, stored procedure, or any other database object.

Finally, `user` is the name of the user from whom you want to revoke privileges.

## Examples

Let's consider a scenario where you want to revoke the `SELECT` and `INSERT` privileges permanently from a user named `myuser` on a table called `customers`. 

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT
ON customers
FROM myuser;
```

If you want to revoke all privileges from the user, you can use the `ALL PRIVILEGES` keyword:

```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES
ON customers
FROM myuser;
```

## Conclusion

Revoking privileges from a user permanently in SQL is a straightforward process using the `REVOKE` statement. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to revoke privileges from users, and use this feature judiciously to maintain the security and integrity of your database.
