In SQL, privileges control the level of access that a user has to a database or its objects. Sometimes, you may need to revoke certain privileges from a user based on specific conditions. This can be done using SQL commands such as `REVOKE`.

## The `REVOKE` Command
The `REVOKE` command is used to revoke privileges previously granted to a user or a role. It allows you to selectively remove specific privileges from a user's account.

## Syntax of the `REVOKE` Command
The basic syntax of the `REVOKE` command is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE privilege_name
ON object_name
FROM user_name;
```

- `privilege_name`: The name of the privilege(s) to be revoked. This can include multiple privileges separated by commas.
- `object_name`: The name of the object (e.g., table, view, procedure) from which the privilege is being revoked.
- `user_name`: The name of the user from whom the privilege is being revoked.

## Revoking Privileges Based on Specific Conditions
To revoke privileges from a user based on specific conditions, you need to use the `WHERE` clause along with the `REVOKE` command. Here's an example that demonstrates how to revoke the `SELECT` privilege from a user based on a condition:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT
ON employees
FROM user_name
WHERE condition;
```

In this example, you need to replace `user_name` with the name of the user from whom the privilege is being revoked. Replace `employees` with the name of the object (e.g., table, view) from which the privilege is being revoked. And `condition` should be a valid SQL condition that determines when the privilege should be revoked.

## Example

Let's say we have a table called `employees` and we want to revoke the `SELECT` privilege from a user named `john_smith` when the employee's salary exceeds a certain threshold:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT
ON employees
FROM john_smith
WHERE salary > 100000;
```

This example would revoke the `SELECT` privilege from the user `john_smith` for the `employees` table only when the salary is greater than $100,000.

By utilizing the `REVOKE` command along with the `WHERE` clause, you can easily revoke privileges from a user in SQL based on specific conditions. This provides fine-grained control over user access and ensures that privileges are granted and revoked as needed.
