In SQL, the **AVG** function is used to calculate the average value of a specified column or expression. This can be useful in situations where you need to find the average of numeric values stored in a table.

However, you can also combine the **AVG** function with arithmetic operators to perform calculations on the average value. This allows you to further manipulate the data and obtain meaningful results.

## Adding Values to the Average

To add values to the average, you can use the **+** operator. This is useful when you want to find the total sum of a column and then divide it by the number of rows to calculate the average including the additional values.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the **+** operator with the **AVG** function:

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name + additional_value) AS average_with_addition
FROM table_name;
```

Replace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to average, and `additional_value` with the value you want to add to the average.

## Subtracting Values from the Average

To subtract values from the average, you can use the **-** operator. This allows you to exclude specific values from the calculation of the average.

Here's an example that shows how to use the **-** operator with the **AVG** function:

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name - excluded_value) AS average_with_subtraction
FROM table_name;
```

Replace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to average, and `excluded_value` with the value you want to subtract from the average.

## Multiplying Values with the Average

If you want to multiply values with the average, you can use the **\*** operator. This can be useful when you want to find the combined effect of multiplying the average value with another column or a constant.

Here's an example that demonstrates how to use the **\*** operator with the **AVG** function:

```sql
SELECT AVG(column_name) * multiplier AS multiplied_average
FROM table_name;
```

Replace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to average, and `multiplier` with the value you want to multiply with the average.

## Dividing Values by the Average

To divide values by the average, you can use the **/** operator. This can be helpful when you need to scale or normalize other values in relation to the average. 

Here's an example that shows how to use the **/** operator with the **AVG** function:

```sql
SELECT column_name / AVG(column_name) AS scaled_values
FROM table_name;
```

Replace `column_name` with the name of the column you want to scale or normalize.

By using the arithmetic operators with the **AVG** function in SQL, you can perform calculations on the average value and obtain more meaningful insights from your data.
