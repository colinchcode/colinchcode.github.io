In business, understanding the average revenue per customer is crucial for determining the profitability of a company and making informed decisions. By calculating this metric, you can gain insights into the value of each customer and identify opportunities for growth. Here, we will explore how to calculate the average revenue per customer using the SQL AVG function.

## SQL Query

Assuming you have a table named "orders" with columns "customer_id" and "revenue", you can use the following SQL query to calculate the average revenue per customer:

```sql
SELECT customer_id, AVG(revenue) AS avg_revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

In this query, we are selecting the "customer_id" column and applying the AVG function to the "revenue" column. The result is renamed as "avg_revenue" using the AS keyword. The GROUP BY clause ensures that the average is calculated per customer.

## Example Usage

Let's say you have the following data in the "orders" table:

| customer_id | revenue |
|-------------|---------|
| 1           | 100     |
| 1           | 200     |
| 2           | 150     |
| 2           | 300     |
| 2           | 400     |

By executing the SQL query mentioned above, you will get the average revenue per customer:

| customer_id | avg_revenue |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 150         |
| 2           | 283.333333 |

In this example, customer 1 had total revenues of 100 and 200, giving an average of 150. Customer 2 had total revenues of 150, 300, and 400, giving an average of approximately 283.33.

## Conclusion

Calculating the average revenue per customer using the SQL AVG function is a straightforward process that can provide valuable insights into customer profitability. By analyzing this metric, businesses can identify the most valuable customers and tailor their strategies accordingly.
