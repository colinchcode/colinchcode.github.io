When working with SQL, there are different command line tools available, depending on the database management system (DBMS) you are using. For this example, we will be using the MySQL command line tool.

To revoke privileges from a user, follow these steps:

Step 1: Open the command prompt or terminal.

Step 2: Connect to the MySQL server using the following command:
```
mysql -u <username> -p
```
Replace `<username>` with the username of the MySQL user you are connecting with.

Step 3: Enter your password when prompted.

Step 4: Once you are connected to the MySQL server, you can revoke privileges using the `REVOKE` command. The basic syntax for revoking privileges is as follows:
```
REVOKE <privilege_type> ON <database_name>.<table_name> FROM '<username>';
```
Replace `<privilege_type>` with the specific privilege you want to revoke, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, etc. Replace `<database_name>` and `<table_name>` with the respective names of the database and table from which you want to revoke the privileges. Finally, replace `<username>` with the username for which you want to revoke the privileges.

Step 5: After entering the `REVOKE` command, press Enter to execute the statement.

Here is an example of revoking the `SELECT` privilege from a user named `john` on the `customers` table in the `mydatabase` database:
```
REVOKE SELECT ON mydatabase.customers FROM 'john';
```

By following these steps, you can easily revoke privileges from a user in SQL using command line tools. It is important to carefully consider the privileges you want to revoke, as removing certain permissions can have significant implications for the user's access to the database. Always ensure that you have a clear understanding of the privileges you are revoking to maintain data integrity and security.
