In SQL, a user can be granted various privileges on database objects such as tables, views, and procedures. However, there might be situations where you need to revoke all privileges from a user. This could be necessary when you want to restrict their access completely or when you need to reset their permissions.

To revoke all privileges from a user in SQL, you would typically follow these steps:

1. Connect to the database using a privileged account such as an administrator or a user with the necessary privileges to revoke permissions.
2. Identify the user for whom you want to revoke all privileges.
3. Execute the `REVOKE` statement to revoke the user's privileges on all relevant objects.

Here is an example of how you can revoke all privileges from a user named 'example_user':

```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_database_name FROM example_user;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA your_schema_name FROM example_user;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA your_schema_name FROM example_user;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA your_schema_name FROM example_user;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL PROCEDURES IN SCHEMA your_schema_name FROM example_user;
```

In the example above, we are revoking all privileges from 'example_user' on the entire database, all tables, sequences, functions, and procedures within the specified schema.

It's important to note that you may need to adapt the syntax and specific object names according to your database management system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle).

By revoking all privileges, you effectively remove the user's ability to interact with the specified database objects. This can effectively restrict their access or provide a clean slate for resetting their permissions.

Remember to exercise caution when revoking privileges, as it can have significant implications on user access and data integrity.
