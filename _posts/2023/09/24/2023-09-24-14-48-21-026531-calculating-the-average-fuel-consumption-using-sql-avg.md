One common task in analyzing vehicle data is calculating the average fuel consumption. In this blog post, we will explore how to use the `AVG` function in SQL to calculate the average fuel consumption.

## Understanding the Data

Before we dive into the SQL query, let's understand the structure of the data we're working with. Assume we have a table called `fuel_consumption` with the following columns:

- `vehicle_id`: the unique identifier for each vehicle.
- `date`: the date when the fuel consumption was recorded.
- `fuel_consumed`: the amount of fuel consumed in liters.

## SQL Query

To calculate the average fuel consumption across all vehicles, we can use the `AVG` function in SQL. Here's an example query:

```sql
SELECT AVG(fuel_consumed) AS avg_fuel_consumption
FROM fuel_consumption;
```

Let's break down the query:

1. `SELECT AVG(fuel_consumed) AS avg_fuel_consumption`: This statement selects the average of the `fuel_consumed` column from the `fuel_consumption` table and aliases it as `avg_fuel_consumption`.

2. `FROM fuel_consumption`: This specifies the table from which we are retrieving the data.

## Example Result

Assuming we have the following data in the `fuel_consumption` table:

| vehicle_id | date       | fuel_consumed |
|------------|------------|---------------|
| 1          | 2021-01-01 | 50            |
| 2          | 2021-01-01 | 40            |
| 1          | 2021-01-02 | 60            |
| 2          | 2021-01-02 | 45            |

Executing the SQL query mentioned earlier will give us the average fuel consumption:

```
avg_fuel_consumption
---------------------
48.75
```

## Conclusion

Calculating average fuel consumption using SQL's `AVG` function is straightforward and can provide valuable insights when analyzing vehicle data. By using simple SQL queries, we can efficiently analyze large datasets and gain important information about fuel efficiency.
