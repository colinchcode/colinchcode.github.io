In web analytics, calculating the average page views is important for understanding the demand and engagement of a website. In this blog post, we will explore how to use SQL to calculate the average page views.

## SQL Query to Calculate Average Page Views
To calculate the average page views using SQL, we can utilize the `AVG()` function. Let's assume we have a table named `page_views` with the following columns:
- `id` (int) - unique identifier for each page view
- `page_url` (varchar) - the URL of the page
- `views` (int) - the number of views for each page

The SQL query to calculate the average page views from the `page_views` table would be:

```sql
SELECT AVG(views) AS average_page_views
FROM page_views;
```

The `AVG()` function calculates the average of the `views` column, and the `AS` keyword is used to name the result column as `average_page_views`.

## Example Usage
Let's consider an example to demonstrate the usage of the SQL query. Assume we have the following data in our `page_views` table:

| id | page_url       | views |
|----|----------------|-------|
| 1  | example.com    | 500   |
| 2  | example.com    | 1000  |
| 3  | example.com    | 750   |
| 4  | example.org    | 1200  |
| 5  | example.org    | 800   |
| 6  | example.org    | 600   |

By executing the SQL query mentioned above, we will get the result:

| average_page_views |
|-------------------|
| 850               |

This means that the average page views across all pages in the `page_views` table is 850.

## Conclusion
Calculating the average page views using SQL is a common task in web analytics. By utilizing the `AVG()` function, we can easily determine the average number of views for a website's pages. This valuable metric can provide insights into the popularity and engagement of specific pages within a website.
