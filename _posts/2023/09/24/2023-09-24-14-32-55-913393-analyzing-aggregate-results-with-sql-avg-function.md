To use the AVG function, you need to specify the column you want to calculate the average for. Let's say we have a table called "sales", with columns "product_name" and "price". We want to calculate the average price of all products sold.

Here is an example of how to use the AVG function in SQL:

```sql
SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM sales;
```

In this example, the AVG function is applied to the "price" column. The result is labeled as "average_price" for clarity. The FROM clause specifies the table we want to aggregate the data from, in this case, "sales".

The result of this query will be a single row containing the average price across all the products in the "sales" table.

You can also combine the AVG function with other SQL functions and clauses to perform more complex analysis. For example, you can use the WHERE clause to filter the data before calculating the average, or use the GROUP BY clause to calculate the average price for each product category.

Overall, the AVG function is a valuable tool for analyzing aggregate data in SQL. It allows you to quickly calculate the average value of a column and gain insights from your database. By leveraging this function along with other SQL functionalities, you can extract meaningful information and make informed decisions based on your data.
