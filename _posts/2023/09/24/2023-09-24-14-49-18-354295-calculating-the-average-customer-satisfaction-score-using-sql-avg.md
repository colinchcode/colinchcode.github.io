To calculate the average customer satisfaction score, you can use the SQL AVG function. This function allows you to calculate the average (mean) value of a column in a table. Here's an example of how you can use the AVG function in SQL to calculate the average customer satisfaction score:

```sql
SELECT AVG(satisfaction_score) AS average_satisfaction_score
FROM customer_reviews;
```

In this example, we assume that you have a table named "customer_reviews" which contains a column named "satisfaction_score" that stores the satisfaction scores of your customers. The AVG function is used to calculate the average value of the "satisfaction_score" column. The result of the query is then aliased as "average_satisfaction_score" for better readability.

By running this SQL query, you will get the average customer satisfaction score across all the records in the "customer_reviews" table.

It's important to note that the calculated average may be affected by outliers or skewed distributions in your data. It's always a good practice to analyze your data further to gain a deeper understanding of customer satisfaction trends.
