To revoke PL/SQL privileges, the REVOKE statement can be used. The syntax for revoking PL/SQL privileges is similar to revoking other types of privileges in Oracle.

Here is an example of how to revoke EXECUTE privilege on a PL/SQL package from a user:

```
REVOKE EXECUTE ON package_name FROM user_name;
```

Replace `package_name` with the name of the PL/SQL package you want to revoke privileges from, and `user_name` with the name of the user from whom you want to revoke the privilege.

Alternatively, you can also revoke privileges at the procedure or function level. Suppose you want to revoke EXECUTE privilege on a specific procedure within a package. Here is how you can do it:

```
REVOKE EXECUTE ON package_name.procedure_name FROM user_name;
```

Replace `procedure_name` with the name of the procedure you want to revoke the privilege from.

It's important to note that when you revoke a privilege, the user will no longer be able to execute the PL/SQL code associated with that privilege. If the user attempts to execute the code, an error will be thrown.

In conclusion, revoking PL/SQL privileges in SQL is a straightforward process using the REVOKE statement. By carefully managing privileges, you can ensure the security and integrity of your Oracle database.
