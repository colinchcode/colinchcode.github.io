Granting Privileges:
To grant privileges to a user or role, we use the `GRANT` statement in SQL Server. Here's an example of granting the `SELECT` privilege on a table called `employees` to a user named `john`:

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO john;
```
In this example, the `SELECT` privilege is granted to the user `john` on the `employees` table.

To grant multiple privileges to a user or role, you can specify them in the `GRANT` statement separated by commas. For example:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO john;
```
In this example, the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` privileges are granted to the user `john` on the `employees` table.

Revoking Privileges:
To revoke privileges from a user or role, we use the `REVOKE` statement in SQL Server. Here's an example of revoking the `SELECT` privilege from the user `john` on the `employees` table:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON employees FROM john;
```
In this example, the `SELECT` privilege is revoked from the user `john` on the `employees` table.

Similar to granting privileges, you can revoke multiple privileges from a user or role by specifying them in the `REVOKE` statement separated by commas. For example:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees FROM john;
```
In this example, the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` privileges are revoked from the user `john` on the `employees` table.

Conclusion:
Managing privileges is crucial for ensuring the security and integrity of your SQL Server databases. By using the `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements, you can easily grant or revoke privileges to users and roles. It is important to regularly review and update the privileges assigned to users and roles to maintain a secure database environment.
