# Combining SQL AVG with Other Aggregate Functions

When working with SQL, it is common to use aggregate functions to perform calculations on groups of data. The `AVG` function, which calculates the average of a set of values, is frequently used in conjunction with other aggregate functions to perform more complex calculations. In this tutorial, we will explore how to combine the `AVG` function with other aggregate functions in SQL.

## Using AVG and SUM Together

One common scenario is to calculate the sum of a column in a table along with the average of another column. Let's assume we have a table called `sales` with columns `quantity` and `price`. We can use the following SQL query to calculate the sum of the `quantity` column and the average of the `price` column:

```sql
SELECT SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM sales;
```

In the above query, we are using the `SUM` function to calculate the sum of the `quantity` column and the `AVG` function to calculate the average of the `price` column. The calculated values are given aliases `total_quantity` and `average_price` using the `AS` keyword.

## Combining AVG with MIN and MAX

Another common use case is to calculate the average along with the minimum and maximum values of a column. Let's say we have a table called `employees` with columns `employee_id` and `salary`. We can use the following SQL query to calculate the average salary along with the minimum and maximum salaries:

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary, MIN(salary) AS min_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees;
```

In the above query, we are using the `AVG` function to calculate the average salary, the `MIN` function to find the minimum salary, and the `MAX` function to find the maximum salary. The calculated values are given aliases `average_salary`, `min_salary`, and `max_salary`.

## Conclusion

By combining the `AVG` function with other aggregate functions in SQL, you can perform powerful calculations on your data. Whether you need to calculate the sum, average, minimum, or maximum, these combinations allow you to gain valuable insights from your database. Experiment with different combinations to extract meaningful information from your data.
