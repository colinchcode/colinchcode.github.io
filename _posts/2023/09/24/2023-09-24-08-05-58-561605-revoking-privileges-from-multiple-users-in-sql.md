In SQL, you can revoke privileges from multiple users by using the `REVOKE` statement. This statement allows you to remove specific privileges that have been previously granted to one or more users.

The syntax for revoking privileges from multiple users is as follows:

```sql
REVOKE privilege_type
ON table_name
FROM user1, user2, user3...;
```

Here, `privilege_type` refers to the specific privilege you want to revoke, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. `table_name` is the name of the table from which you want to revoke the privilege.

To revoke privileges from multiple users, simply list the usernames separated by commas after the `FROM` keyword.

### Examples

Let's say you want to revoke the `SELECT` privilege from users named `user1`, `user2`, and `user3` on a table called `employees`. The SQL statement would be:

```sql
REVOKE SELECT
ON employees
FROM user1, user2, user3;
```

Likewise, if you want to revoke the `INSERT` privilege from the same set of users, you can use the following statement:

```sql
REVOKE INSERT
ON employees
FROM user1, user2, user3;
```

By executing these `REVOKE` statements, you will successfully remove the specified privileges from the designated users on the `employees` table.

Remember to adjust the `privilege_type`, `table_name`, and user names to fit your specific requirements.

These were the steps to revoke privileges from multiple users in SQL. Use this feature responsibly to manage access control and security in your database environment.
