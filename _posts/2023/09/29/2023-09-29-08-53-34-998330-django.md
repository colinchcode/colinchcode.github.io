Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows you to build robust and scalable web applications quickly. It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and includes a wide range of features that make web development efficient and secure.

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of setting up a Django project and creating a simple web application.

## Installation

Before getting started with Django, you need to ensure that Python is installed on your system. Open a terminal and run the following command to check the Python version:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Once Python is installed, you can install Django using `pip`, the package installer for Python. Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install django
```

## Project Setup

To create a new Django project, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project. Run the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

This will create a new directory named `myproject` with the basic project structure.

## Creating an App

An app in Django is a self-contained module that houses a specific functionality of the web application. To create a new app, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

This will create a new directory named `myapp` with the app's structure.

## Defining Models

Models in Django represent the structure and behavior of data in the application. Open the `myapp/models.py` file and define your models using Python classes. For example:

```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    publication_date = models.DateField()

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

In the above code, we define a `Book` model with three fields: `title`, `author`, and `publication_date`. The `__str__` method specifies how the object should be represented as a string.

## Creating Views

Views in Django handle the logic behind the web application. Open the `myapp/views.py` file and define your views using Python functions or classes. For example:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

def home(request):
    return HttpResponse("Welcome to my Django app!")

def books(request):
    books = Book.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'myapp/books.html', {'books': books})
```

In the above code, we define two views: `home` and `books`. The `home` view simply returns a plain text response, while the `books` view queries all the `Book` objects and renders them in the `books.html` template.

## Routing URLs

URL routing in Django determines how URLs are mapped to views. Open the `myproject/urls.py` file and define your URL patterns using regular expressions. For example:

```python
from django.urls import path
from myapp import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home, name='home'),
    path('books/', views.books, name='books'),
]
```

In the above code, we define two URL patterns: the root URL (`''`) maps to the `home` view, and the `/books/` URL maps to the `books` view.

## Running the Application

To run the Django development server, navigate to the project's root directory and run the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to see your web application in action.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we covered the basics of getting started with Django. We learned how to install Django, set up a new project, create an app, define models, create views, and route URLs. Now you have a foundation to build more complex and feature-rich web applications using Django.
