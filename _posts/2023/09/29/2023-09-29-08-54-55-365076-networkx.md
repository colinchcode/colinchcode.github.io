## What is NetworkX? {#what-is-networkx}
NetworkX is a Python library that handles the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It can be used to analyze social networks, transport networks, biological networks, and more. Whether you want to model relationships, calculate path lengths, or find communities within a network, NetworkX has you covered.

## Installation {#installation}
To install NetworkX, you can use pip, the Python package manager. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```
pip install networkx
```

## Creating a Graph {#creating-a-graph}
To get started with NetworkX, you need to create a graph object. You can choose from different types of graphs, such as directed, undirected, weighted, or unweighted graphs. Here's an example of how to create an undirected graph:

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create an empty undirected graph
G = nx.Graph()
```

## Adding Nodes and Edges {#adding-nodes-and-edges}
Once you have created a graph, you can add nodes and edges to it. Nodes can be any hashable object, such as integers, strings, or even custom objects. Here's how you can add nodes and edges to the graph:

```python
# Add nodes
G.add_node(1)
G.add_node("A")
G.add_node("B")

# Add edges
G.add_edge(1, "A")
G.add_edge(1, "B")
G.add_edge("A", "B")
```

## Graph Analysis {#graph-analysis}
NetworkX provides a wide range of built-in graph analysis functions. You can calculate various properties of the graph, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, clustering coefficient, and more. Here's an example of how to calculate the degree centrality of nodes in a graph:

```python
# Calculate degree centrality
degree_centrality = nx.degree_centrality(G)
print(degree_centrality)
```

## Visualization {#visualization}
NetworkX also offers various options for visualizing graphs. You can use matplotlib, Graphviz, or other visualization libraries to create visual representations of your graphs. Here's an example of how to visualize a graph using matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Draw the graph
nx.draw(G, with_labels=True)
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion {#conclusion}
NetworkX is a versatile Python library for graph analysis with a wide range of features and functionalities. It simplifies the process of creating, manipulating, and analyzing complex networks. Whether you are working on social network analysis, recommendation systems, or graph algorithms, NetworkX provides a user-friendly interface to explore and understand network data.
