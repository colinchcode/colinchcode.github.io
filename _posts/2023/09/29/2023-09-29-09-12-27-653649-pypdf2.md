## Installation

To install PyPDF2, you can use `pip` - the Python package manager. Open your terminal and execute the following command:

```
pip install PyPDF2
```

## Reading PDF files

To read a PDF file using PyPDF2, you need to open the file using `open()` and create a `PdfReader` object:

```python
import PyPDF2

pdf_file = open('example.pdf', 'rb')
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)
```

Once you have the `PdfReader` object, you can access various properties of the PDF file, such as the number of pages:

```python
total_pages = len(pdf_reader.pages)
```

You can also extract text from a specific page:

```python
page_number = 0
page = pdf_reader.pages[page_number]
text = page.extract_text()
```

## Merging PDF files

To merge multiple PDF files into a single one, you can use the `PdfFileMerger` class:

```python
pdf_merger = PyPDF2.PdfFileMerger()

pdf_merger.append('file1.pdf')
pdf_merger.append('file2.pdf')
pdf_merger.append('file3.pdf')

output_file = open('merged.pdf', 'wb')
pdf_merger.write(output_file)
output_file.close()
```

## Splitting PDF files

To split a PDF file into multiple smaller ones, you can use the `PdfFileReader` class:

```python
pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader('original.pdf')

for page_number in range(pdf_reader.numPages):
    pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()
    pdf_writer.addPage(pdf_reader.getPage(page_number))

    output_file = open(f'page_{page_number}.pdf', 'wb')
    pdf_writer.write(output_file)
    output_file.close()
```

## Manipulating PDF pages

PyPDF2 also allows you to manipulate PDF pages by rotating, cropping, or adding watermarks. Here's an example of rotating a page:

```python
pdf_writer = PyPDF2.PdfFileWriter()

page = pdf_reader.getPage(0)
page.rotateClockwise(90)

pdf_writer.addPage(page)

output_file = open('rotated.pdf', 'wb')
pdf_writer.write(output_file)
output_file.close()
```

## Conclusion

PyPDF2 is a versatile Python library that simplifies working with PDF files. We explored its functionalities for reading, merging, splitting, and manipulating PDF documents. It is a powerful tool that can be used in various scenarios, from automating PDF-related tasks to extracting data from PDF files. Hopefully, this introduction has sparked your interest to dive deeper into the capabilities of PyPDF2.
