Regular expressions are a powerful tool for pattern matching and extracting data from strings in Python. When using regular expressions, you can define capturing groups to extract specific parts of a pattern. Capturing groups allow you to isolate and retrieve portions of the matched text.

In Python, capturing groups are denoted by enclosing a portion of the regular expression pattern in parentheses `()`. The content inside the parentheses represents the captured group. 

Let's look at an example to understand how capturing groups work:

```python
import re

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

# Define a regular expression pattern with capturing groups
pattern = r"(\w+) (\w+) (\w+) (\w+) (\w+) (\w+) (\w+) (\w+)"

# Search for the pattern in the text
match = re.search(pattern, text)

# Access the captured groups using the group() method
print(match.group(1))  # The
print(match.group(2))  # quick
print(match.group(3))  # brown
print(match.group(4))  # fox
print(match.group(5))  # jumps
print(match.group(6))  # over
print(match.group(7))  # the
print(match.group(8))  # lazy
```

In this example, the regular expression pattern consists of eight capturing groups, each capturing a word (`\w+`). We use the `re.search()` function to search for the pattern in the given text. Once the pattern is found, we can access the captured groups using the `group()` method on the `match` object.

The `group()` method takes an index (starting from 1) as an argument and returns the text matched by the corresponding capturing group. In this case, we retrieve and print each captured group individually.

Capturing groups are useful when you need to extract specific information from a text using regular expressions. They allow you to isolate and manipulate the desired portions of the matched text.

In addition to the `group()` method, Python provides other methods like `groups()` and `groupdict()` to access captured groups in different ways. You can refer to the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) for more details on these methods.

Next time you find yourself working with regular expressions in Python, remember the power of capturing groups to extract and manipulate specific parts of the matched text.
