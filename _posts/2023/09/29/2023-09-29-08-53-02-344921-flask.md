Flask is a web framework written in Python that helps you build web applications quickly and efficiently. It is lightweight, easy to use, and highly customizable, making it a popular choice among developers.

In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up Flask and building a simple web application.

## Installation

To install Flask, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Once the installation is complete, you're ready to start creating your Flask app.

## Creating a Basic Flask App

To create a basic Flask app, open a new Python file and import the Flask module:

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In the code above, we first create an instance of the Flask class and assign it to the variable `app`. We then define a route `/` and associate it with a function `hello_world()`. When the user visits the root URL of the app, this function is executed and the message "Hello, World!" is returned. Finally, we use the `app.run()` method to start the Flask development server.

Save the file with a `.py` extension, such as `app.py`, and run it using the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

You can then visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to see the "Hello, World!" message.

## Routing

Routing in Flask determines how the app responds to different URLs. You can define routes using the `@app.route` decorator.

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Home Page'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'About Page'
```

In the code above, we have defined two routes: the root URL `/` and the `/about` URL. When a user visits these URLs, the corresponding functions (`index()` and `about()`) are executed and the respective messages are returned.

## Template Rendering

Flask allows you to render templates to create dynamic web pages. Templates are HTML files with placeholders for dynamic content.

First, create a `templates` directory in your project folder, and within that directory, create an HTML file, such as `index.html`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Flask App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Flask App</h1>
    <p>{{ message }}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

In your Flask app, import the `render_template` function and modify the route functions to render templates.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', message='Hello, World!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this example, we have imported `render_template` and modified the `index()` function to render the `index.html` template. The `message` variable is passed as a parameter to the template and is rendered in the HTML.

When you visit `http://localhost:5000`, you will see the dynamic content rendered from the template.

## Static Files

Flask allows you to serve static files like CSS and JavaScript. Create a `static` directory in your project folder and place your static files inside it.

To link these files in your HTML templates, use the `url_for()` function.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Flask App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to Flask App</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

In the code above, we have linked a `style.css` file from the `static` directory to the HTML template using the `url_for()` function.

## Conclusion

Flask is a versatile web framework that allows you to build web applications efficiently. With its simple syntax and extensive documentation, it's a great choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Start building your Flask apps today and unleash the power of Python for web development.
