In today's globalized world, it has become increasingly important for app developers to cater to users from different linguistic backgrounds. One way to achieve this is by building a multi-language app that can seamlessly switch between different languages based on user preferences. In this blog post, we will explore how to accomplish this using Redux and i18next.

## Getting Started

Before delving into the implementation details, let's quickly outline the prerequisites for building a multi-language app with Redux and i18next:

1. Basic understanding of React and Redux.
2. Familiarity with i18next library for internationalization.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

To begin, we need to install the necessary dependencies for our project. Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and execute the following command:

```shell
npm install --save redux react-redux i18next i18next-react i18next-browser-languagedetector
```

This command will install Redux, React Redux bindings, i18next library, and necessary plugins for language detection in the browser.

## Step 2: Set Up Redux Store

Next, we need to set up a Redux store to handle the state management of our app. Create a new **store.js** file and add the following code:

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import rootReducer from './reducers';

const store = createStore(rootReducer);

export default store;
```

In this code snippet, we import the createStore function from Redux and create a store using our root reducer. You can customize the rootReducer to suit your app's needs.

## Step 3: Configure i18next

Now, let's configure **i18next** to enable translation in our app. Create a new **i18n.js** file and add the following code:

```javascript
import i18next from 'i18next';
import { initReactI18next } from 'react-i18next';
import LanguageDetector from 'i18next-browser-languagedetector';

i18next
  .use(LanguageDetector)
  .use(initReactI18next)
  .init({
    fallbackLng: 'en',
    detection: {
      order: ['navigator']
    },
    resources: {
      en: {
        translation: {
          // English translations
        },
      },
      fr: {
        translation: {
          // French translations
        },
      },
    },
  });

export default i18next;
```

In this code snippet, we import the necessary modules from **i18next** and configure the language detection using **LanguageDetector**. We also provide translations for English and French languages in the **resources** section.

## Step 4: Create Language Reducer

Now, let's create a Redux reducer to handle the language selection in our app. Create a new **languageReducer.js** file and add the following code:

```javascript
const languageReducer = (state = 'en', action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'SET_LANGUAGE':
      return action.payload;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default languageReducer;
```

In this code snippet, we define a reducer that handles the "SET_LANGUAGE" action and updates the state with the selected language.

## Step 5: Update Root Reducer

Next, we need to update the root reducer to include our newly created **languageReducer**. Open the **reducers/index.js** file and modify it as follows:

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import languageReducer from './languageReducer';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  language: languageReducer,
});

export default rootReducer;
```

In this code snippet, we import the **combineReducers** function from Redux and combine our **languageReducer** with other reducers if needed.

## Step 6: Implement Language Switcher Component

Now, let's create a LanguageSwitcher component to allow users to switch between supported languages. Create a new **LanguageSwitcher.js** file and add the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { useTranslation } from 'react-i18next';

const LanguageSwitcher = () => {
  const { t, i18n } = useTranslation();
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  const handleLanguageChange = (language) => {
    dispatch({ type: 'SET_LANGUAGE', payload: language });
    i18n.changeLanguage(language);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => handleLanguageChange('en')}>{t('english')}</button>
      <button onClick={() => handleLanguageChange('fr')}>{t('french')}</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default LanguageSwitcher;
```

In this code snippet, we use the **useTranslation** hook from **react-i18next** to access the translation function **t** and the **i18n** instance. We also use the **useDispatch** hook from **react-redux** to dispatch the language change action to the Redux store.

## Step 7: Integrate Language Switcher

Finally, integrate the LanguageSwitcher component into your app's main component. Import and render the **LanguageSwitcher** component where appropriate in your app's component hierarchy.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store';
import LanguageSwitcher from './LanguageSwitcher';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <div>
        {/* Your app's content */}
        <LanguageSwitcher />
      </div>
    </Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```
