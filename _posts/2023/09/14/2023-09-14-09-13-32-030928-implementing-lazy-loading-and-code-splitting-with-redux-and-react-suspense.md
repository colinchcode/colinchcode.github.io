In modern web applications, performance is key to providing a good user experience. One way to improve performance is by implementing lazy loading and code splitting, which allows us to load only the necessary code for a specific route or feature of our application.

In this blog post, we will explore how to implement lazy loading and code splitting in a React application that uses Redux for state management, along with the new React Suspense feature.

## What is lazy loading?

Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of non-critical resources (such as code or assets) until they are actually needed. This means that instead of loading everything upfront when the application loads, we can load specific pieces of code or assets on demand, reducing the initial load time and improving performance.

## What is code splitting?

Code splitting is the process of splitting the application code into smaller chunks, which can be loaded independently. This allows us to load only the required code for a specific page or feature, rather than loading the entire application code upfront. Code splitting helps minimize the initial load time and allows for better resource utilization.

## Lazy loading and code splitting with React Suspense

React Suspense is a new feature introduced in React 16.6 that allows components to "suspend" rendering while they load asynchronous dependencies, such as data or code. This is particularly useful for implementing lazy loading and code splitting.

To implement lazy loading and code splitting with React Suspense, we can make use of the dynamic import syntax, which allows us to import modules asynchronously. We can then wrap the component that needs to be lazy loaded with the `Suspense` component, specifying a fallback UI to display while the component is being loaded.

Let's see an example of how to implement lazy loading and code splitting with Redux and React Suspense:

```javascript
import React, { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore } from 'redux';

// Import your Redux store and reducer
import rootReducer from './reducers';
const store = createStore(rootReducer);

// Lazy load the component using dynamic import
const LazyComponent = lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Provider store={store}>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <LazyComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </Provider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In the example above, we create a Redux store and wrap our `App` component with the `Provider` component from `react-redux` to provide the store to our components.

We then use the `lazy` function from React to dynamically import the `LazyComponent` asynchronously. The `import()` function uses the dynamic import syntax to lazy load the component, meaning it will only be fetched and loaded when needed.

We wrap the `LazyComponent` with the `Suspense` component and provide a fallback UI to display while the component is being loaded. In this case, we simply show a "Loading..." message, but you can customize the fallback UI to match your application design.

Finally, we export the `App` component as our main entry point.

With this setup, the `LazyComponent` will only be loaded when it's actually needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving the application's performance.

## Conclusion

Lazy loading and code splitting are powerful techniques to improve the performance of web applications by deferring the loading of non-critical resources and loading only the required code for a specific route or feature.

In this blog post, we explored how to implement lazy loading and code splitting in a React application that uses Redux for state management, along with the new React Suspense feature. By leveraging dynamic import and React Suspense, we can achieve optimal performance and provide a seamless user experience.
