In this tutorial, we will explore how to build an e-commerce application using Redux for state management and the Stripe API for payment processing. By combining these powerful technologies, we can create a secure and reliable online shopping experience for our users.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine
- **React** and **Redux** knowledge
- A **Stripe** account with your API keys

## Setting Up the Project

Let's start by setting up our project:

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
2. Initialize a new React application by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
npx create-react-app ecommerce-app-redux
```

3. Navigate into the project directory:

```shell
cd ecommerce-app-redux
```

4. Install the required packages for Redux and Stripe:

```shell
npm install redux react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

## Configuring Stripe API

To use the Stripe API in our application, we need to configure it with our API keys. The keys can be found in your Stripe account dashboard.

1. Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file:

```dotenv
REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_publishable_key
REACT_APP_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Make sure to replace `your_publishable_key` and `your_secret_key` with your actual Stripe API keys.

## Building the Redux Store

Let's set up our Redux store to manage the state of our e-commerce application.

1. Create a new directory named `src/redux`.
2. Inside the `redux` directory, create a new file named `store.js`.
3. Open the `store.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // Add your reducers here
  },
});

export default store;
```

4. Let's create a sample reducer to get started. Create a new file named `src/redux/cartSlice.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const cartSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'cart',
  initialState: [],
  reducers: {
    addItem: (state, action) => {
      state.push(action.payload);
    },
    removeItem: (state, action) => {
      return state.filter(item => item.id !== action.payload.id);
    },
  },
});

export const { addItem, removeItem } = cartSlice.actions;

export default cartSlice.reducer;
```

5. Now, open `src/redux/store.js` and update the `reducers` field with your created reducers. For example:

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import cartReducer from './cartSlice.js';

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    cart: cartReducer,
  },
});

export default store;
```

Congratulations! You have set up your Redux store and created a sample reducer for the cart.

## Integrating Stripe API

Now, let's integrate the Stripe API to handle the payment processing of our e-commerce application.

1. Create a new directory named `src/components`.
2. Inside the `components` directory, create a new file named `PaymentForm.js`.
3. Open `PaymentForm.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { CardElement, useStripe, useElements } from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

const PaymentForm = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    if (!stripe || !elements) {
      return;
    }

    const cardElement = elements.getElement(CardElement);

    const { error, paymentMethod } = await stripe.createPaymentMethod({
      type: 'card',
      card: cardElement,
    });

    if (error) {
      console.log(error);
    } else {
      console.log(paymentMethod);
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <CardElement />
      <button type="submit" disabled={!stripe}>
        Pay
      </button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default PaymentForm;
```

4. Now, you can use the `PaymentForm` component in your application to handle payments. For example, you can create a new `CheckoutPage` component and import `PaymentForm` inside it.

Congratulations! You have successfully built an e-commerce application with Redux for state management and integrated the Stripe API for payment processing.

Remember to handle the payment response from the Stripe API by linking it with your backend server.
