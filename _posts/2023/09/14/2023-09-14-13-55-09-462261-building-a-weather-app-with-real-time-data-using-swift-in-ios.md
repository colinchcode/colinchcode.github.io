In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building a weather app in iOS using Swift. Our goal is to fetch real-time weather data from an API and display it in a user-friendly interface.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Xcode installed on your Mac
- Basic knowledge of Swift programming language
- A weather API key (we will use OpenWeatherMap API in this example)

## Steps to Build the Weather App:

### Step 1: Set up the project

- Open Xcode and create a new iOS project.
- Select "Single View App" template and provide a suitable name for your project.

### Step 2: Design the User Interface

- Open the Main.storyboard file and design the UI for your weather app. Include labels, images, or any other UI elements to display the weather information.

### Step 3: Create a Weather Model

- Create a new Swift file and define a struct named `Weather` to hold the weather data like temperature, humidity, etc.
- Add properties to the struct based on the data you will retrieve from the API.

```swift
struct Weather {
    let temperature: Double
    let humidity: Int
    // Add more properties as needed
}
```

### Step 4: Fetch Data from Weather API

- Create a new Swift file and define a class named `WeatherManager`.
- Implement a method to fetch weather data from the API using URLSession or a networking library like Alamofire.

```swift
class WeatherManager {
    let apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
    let baseUrl = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

    func fetchWeatherData(for city: String, completion: @escaping (Weather?) -> Void) {
        guard let url = URL(string: "\(baseUrl)?q=\(city)&appid=\(apiKey)") else {
            completion(nil)
            return
        }

        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { (data, response, error) in
            if let data = data, let weatherData = try? JSONDecoder().decode(WeatherData.self, from: data) {
                let weather = Weather(temperature: weatherData.main.temp, humidity: weatherData.main.humidity)
                completion(weather)
            } else {
                completion(nil)
            }
        }.resume()
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Update UI with Weather Data

- In your View Controller, create an instance of `WeatherManager` and call the `fetchWeatherData` method with the desired city.

```swift
let weatherManager = WeatherManager()

weatherManager.fetchWeatherData(for: "New York") { [weak self] weather in
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        if let weather = weather {
            // Update UI with weather data
            self?.temperatureLabel.text = "\(weather.temperature)Â°C"
            self?.humidityLabel.text = "\(weather.humidity)%"
        } else {
            // Show error message or handle error case
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Run the App

- Build and run your app to see the real-time weather data for the desired city.

That's it! You have successfully built a weather app with real-time data using Swift in iOS. Feel free to customize the app further by adding more features or integrating additional APIs for richer weather information.
