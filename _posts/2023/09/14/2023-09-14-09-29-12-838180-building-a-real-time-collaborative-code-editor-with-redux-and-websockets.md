In this tutorial, we will explore how to build a real-time collaborative code editor using Redux and WebSockets. Real-time collaboration allows multiple users to simultaneously edit and see changes in a shared code editor in real-time. 

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Node.js installed on your machine
- Familiarity with Redux and WebSockets

## Setting Up the Project

Start by creating a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal. Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

```shell
npm init -y
```

Next, install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:

```shell
npm install express redux react react-dom redux-thunk redux-websocket
```

## Setting Up the Server

Create a new file called `server.js` and add the following code to set up a simple Express server:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.static('public'));

const server = app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

## Setting Up the Client

Create a new directory called `public` and inside it, create an HTML file called `index.html`. Add the following code to the `index.html` file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="bundle.js"></script> <!-- Assuming you bundle your code -->
  </body>
</html>
```

Create a new file called `index.js` in the root directory of your project. This file will serve as the entry point for our application. Add the following code to it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux';
import thunk from 'redux-thunk';
import { websocketMiddleware } from 'redux-websocket';
import rootReducer from './reducers';
import App from './components/App';

const store = createStore(
  rootReducer,
  applyMiddleware(thunk, websocketMiddleware('ws://localhost:3000/ws'))
);

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Building the Collaborative Code Editor

Create a new directory called `components` in the root directory of your project. Inside it, create a new file called `CodeEditor.js`. This file will contain the implementation of our collaborative code editor. Add the following code to it:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { updateCode } from '../actions';

const CodeEditor = () => {
  const code = useSelector((state) => state.code);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const [editorValue, setEditorValue] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    setEditorValue(code);
  }, [code]);

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setEditorValue(e.target.value);
    dispatch(updateCode(e.target.value));
  };

  return (
    <textarea value={editorValue} onChange={handleChange}></textarea>
  );
};

export default CodeEditor;
```

In the same `components` directory, create another file called `App.js`. Add the following code to it:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import CodeEditor from './CodeEditor';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor</h1>
      <CodeEditor />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Handling Code Updates

Create a new directory called `actions` in the root directory of your project. Inside it, create a new file called `index.js`. Add the following code to it:

```javascript
export const updateCode = (code) => ({
  type: 'UPDATE_CODE',
  payload: code,
});
```

## Handling Code Updates on the Server

Inside the `server.js` file, add the following code to handle incoming WebSocket connections and code updates:

```javascript
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (code) => {
    // Broadcast the code update to all connected clients
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(code);
      }
    });
  });
});
```

## Updating the Redux Store

Create a new directory called `reducers` in the root directory of your project. Inside it, create a new file called `index.js`. Add the following code to it:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  code: '',
};

const rootReducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'UPDATE_CODE':
      return {
        ...state,
        code: action.payload,
      };
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

export default rootReducer;
```

## Running the Application

To run the application, run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
node server.js
```

Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`. You should now see the real-time collaborative code editor.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to build a real-time collaborative code editor using Redux and WebSockets. We covered the setup of the server and the client, building the code editor component with React, handling code updates in Redux, and broadcasting updates with WebSockets.

Now you have the knowledge and tools to create your own real-time collaborative applications! #RealTimeCoding #ReduxWebSockets
