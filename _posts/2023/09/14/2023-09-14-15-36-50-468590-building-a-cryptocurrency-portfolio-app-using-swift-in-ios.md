In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of building a cryptocurrency portfolio app using Swift in iOS. Our app will allow users to track their cryptocurrency investments and monitor their portfolio in real-time.

## Features of the App
- Portfolio Summary: Displaying the current value of the portfolio consisting of various cryptocurrencies.
- Coin List: Displaying a list of available cryptocurrencies with their current prices and percentage changes.
- Coin Details: Providing detailed information about a selected cryptocurrency, including price charts and historical data.

## Getting Started
To get started, let's create a new Xcode project and choose the iOS App template. Make sure to select Swift as the programming language. Once the project is created, we can begin implementing our app.

## User Interface
The user interface will consist of multiple view controllers and a tab bar controller to navigate between different sections of the app. We can use Interface Builder or programmatically create the user interface elements.

## Fetching Cryptocurrency Data
To fetch real-time data for cryptocurrencies, we can utilize an API service such as CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap. We need to make HTTP requests to retrieve the data and parse the JSON response. We can use Swift's built-in URLSession or third-party libraries like Alamofire for making network requests.

## Data Storage
To store and manage the user's crypto investments, we can leverage a local database or cloud-based storage. Options like CoreData or Realm can be used for local data persistence, whereas services like Firebase or Parse can handle remote data synchronization.

## Displaying Data in Views
Once we have fetched the cryptocurrency data, we need to display it in our views. We can utilize UITableView or UICollectionView to present the list of coins and their details. Custom cells and headers can be used to display additional information such as coin logos or price charts.

## Portfolio Calculation
To calculate the value of the user's portfolio, we need to combine the prices of all the cryptocurrencies they own. We can fetch the user's holdings from the data storage and perform the calculation using current prices.

## Real-Time Updates
To provide real-time updates, we can implement a WebSocket connection to subscribe to price changes of selected cryptocurrencies. Whenever the price changes, we can update the displayed values to provide the latest information to the user.

## Conclusion
Building a cryptocurrency portfolio app using Swift in iOS involves fetching real-time data, designing a user-friendly interface, and implementing features like portfolio calculation and real-time updates. This tutorial provides a basic overview of the steps involved in building such an app. You can explore more advanced features like authentication, push notifications, and more, to enhance the app further.
