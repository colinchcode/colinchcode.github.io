Undo/redo functionality is a crucial feature in many web applications, allowing users to easily revert and redo their actions. In this blog post, we will explore how to implement this functionality using Redux, a popular state management library for JavaScript applications.

## Getting Started

Before we begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of Redux and its core concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.

## Step 1: Setting Up the Redux Store

To implement undo/redo functionality, we need to store the application state history. To do this, we can leverage the power of middleware in Redux.

First, let's install the `redux-undo` library, which provides an out-of-the-box solution for managing undo/redo functionality in Redux:

```bash
npm install redux-undo
```

Next, import the necessary functions from `redux-undo` and create the undoable reducer:

```javascript
import undoable from 'redux-undo';

const undoableReducer = undoable(originalReducer);
```

The `undoable` function takes the original reducer and returns a new reducer that handles undo/redo actions.

## Step 2: Dispatching Actions

Now that we have set up the undoable reducer, we can start dispatching actions to update the application state.

First, define your actions as usual:

```javascript
const addTodo = (text) => {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    payload: {
      id: Math.random(),
      text,
    },
  };
};
```

Then, dispatch the actions using the `store.dispatch` method:

```javascript
store.dispatch(addTodo('Buy groceries'));
```

## Step 3: Handling Undo and Redo Actions

To handle undo and redo actions, we need to add buttons or any other user interface elements that trigger these actions. We can use React and Redux to handle the user interface part, but in this post, we will focus on the Redux part only.

To implement the undo action, dispatch the `undo` action provided by the `redux-undo` library:

```javascript
store.dispatch(ActionCreators.undo());
```

Similarly, to implement the redo action, dispatch the `redo` action:

```javascript
store.dispatch(ActionCreators.redo());
```

## Conclusion

You have successfully implemented undo/redo functionality using Redux in your web app. With this feature, your users can easily revert and redo their actions, enhancing the overall user experience.

Remember to leverage the power of middleware like `redux-undo` to simplify the implementation process and save development time.

Happy coding!
